      "September 26 2016,HILLARY CLINTON,DONALD TRUMP,\"\"\" How are you, Donald? [applause] Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future well build together. Today is my granddaughters second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for womens work.I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. Ive heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that youre under. So lets have paid family leave, earned sick days. Lets be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.How are we going to do it? Were going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, its good to be with you. Were going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th. Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the worlds population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than weve ever had.I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because thats exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.We just have a different view about whats best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and thats all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off well be and that everything will work out from there.I dont buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better well grow. Thats the kind of economy I want us to see again. Well, lets stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money. Well, it did collapse. Nine million peoplenine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So were now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.Independent experts have looked at what Ive proposed and looked at what Donalds proposed, and basically theyve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.Theyve looked at my plans and theyve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think its real. I think science is real. And I think its important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And heres what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. Thats a lot of jobs; thats a lot of new economic activity.So Ive tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that were going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress weve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place. Well, actually... Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit. And I havewell, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again... ... million new jobs, a balanced budget... Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if were actually going to look at the facts.When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.But lets not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and Ive said what Im going to do. Im going to have a special prosecutor. Were going to enforce the trade deals we have, and were going to hold people accountable.When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs. Well, Ive been a senator, Donald... And I have been a secretary of state... And I have done a lot... Well, thats your opinion. That is your opinion. Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in... No. Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts areI did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated... ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasnt. I wrote about that in my book... ... before you even announced. Look, there are differences... There are... There are different views about whats good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think its important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. Thats why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt. But inoh, but I do. In fact, I have written a book about it. Its called Stronger Together. You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore... ... or at an airport near you. But its because I see thiswe need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession. That cantthat cant be left to stand. I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so... So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and weve turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed... ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think its time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country. Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS. No, were not. No, were not. Thats athatsgo to theplease, fact checkers, get to work. I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, Im going to be blamed for everything thats ever happened. Why not? Yeah, why not? [laughter]You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case... Yeah, well, lets start the clock again, Lester. Weve looked at your tax proposals. I dont see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals youre referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money thats stranded overseas. I happen to support that. I happen toI happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. Youve proposed an approach that has a... ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing... ... it is... ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasnt worked.And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.I dont think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance theirtheir debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top. Well, I think youve seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when youre under audit.So youve got to ask yourself, why wont he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe hes not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe hes not as charitable as he claims to be.Third, we dont know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesnt want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybodys ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didnt pay any federal income tax. So if hes paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably hes not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that hes trying to hide.And the financial disclosure statements, they dont give you the tax rate. They dont give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that hes ever going to release his tax returns, because theres something hes hiding.And well guess. Well keep guessing at what it might be that hes hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them. I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But Im not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that. And maybe because you havent paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. [applause]And the other thing I think is important... ... is if yourif your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. Ive met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. Its a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldnt pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do... Well, to... Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?I can only say that Im certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.And when we talk about your business, youve taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States. Well, sometimes theres not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government. And we need to be very clear about that. Well, youre right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how theyre treated in the criminal justice system. Weve just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.And weve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that theyre well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.Right now, thats not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. Ive laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And weve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that were seeing today. Well, Ive heardIve heard Donald say this at his rallies, and its really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country. You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. Theres a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just dont want to see it creep back up. Weve had 25 years of very good cooperation.But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And its just a fact that if youre a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So weve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to saywe have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.We need to have more second chance programs. Im glad that were ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldnt have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right nowand this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobbyright now, weve got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone whos on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If youre too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way. Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.Ive met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit its an issue. Theyve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that. Well, its also fair to say, if were going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is... No, Im not. New YorkNew York has done an excellent job. And I give creditI give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?But lets also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem. Well, II do think... I thinkI thinkI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think thats a good thing. [applause] Well, just listen to what you heard. [laughter]And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.But it cant be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trumps best efforts to bring him down. Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly were facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. Theres no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donalds very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...[crosstalk]...tough, long game here. And one of the things hes done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clearwhether its Russia, China, Iran or anybody elsethe United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.And were going to have to make it clear that we dont want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We dont want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.And the Russians need to understand that. I think theyve been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And thats why I was soI was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. Its one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican informationin administrations... ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. Its comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face. Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.Were making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And were hoping that within the year well be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.But we have to be cognizant of the fact that theyve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because weve got to defeat ISIS, and weve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online. Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq. That is absolutely proved over and over again. He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.But the larger pointand he says this constantlyis George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.But lets talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? Thats the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?And I think weve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.So weve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means weve got to work more closely with our allies, and thats something that Donald has been very dismissive of.Were working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. Were working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.Theyre on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donalds rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to. Lester, weve covered... Weve covered this ground. Whew, OK. [laughter]Lets talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time its ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasnt enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Irans nuclear program without firing a single shot. Thats diplomacy. Thats coalition-building. Thats working with other nations.The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, Id blow them out of the water and start another war. Thats not good judgment. That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part... ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didnt care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, thats fine... ... have a good time, folks. And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned. Its a good one, though. It well describes the problem. [laughter] Well, let melet me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.It is essential that Americas word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. Ive talked with a number of them. But I want toon behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.Its also important that we look at the entire global situation. Theres no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, Id rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If hes going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But its like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says its a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? Thats what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether theyre abroad or at home.We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security... ... to be given any opportunities at all. Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina. [applause] Well, one thing. One thing, Lester. You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said... .... women dont deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men. And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman Miss Piggy. Then he called her Miss Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet... ... shes going to vote this November. Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.And I know Donalds trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This elections really up to you. Its not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.\"\"\",\"\"\" Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. Theyre going to Mexico. Theyre going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. Theyre devaluing their currency, and theres nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because theyre using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.So were losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at whats happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said its the eighth wonder of the world. Theyre building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. Theyre all leaving. And we cant allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do, but perhaps well be talking about that later.But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They leftfired 1,400 people. Theyre going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, Ill be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. Thats going to be a job creator like we havent seen since Ronald Reagan. Its going to be a beautiful thing to watch.Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. Well, for one thingand before we start on thatmy father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company thats worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because thats the kind of thinking that our country needs.Our countrys in deep trouble. We dont know what were doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. Theyre the best, the best ever at it. What theyre doing to us is a very, very sad thing.So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, theyre taking our jobs, theyre giving incentives, theyre doing things that, frankly, we dont do.Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. Were on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, theres a tax. When they sell inautomatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, theres no tax. Its a defective agreement. Its been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians havent done anything about it.Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clintonyes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. Its very important to me.But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. Shes been doing this for 30 years. And why hasnt she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact... Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that weve created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. Whats happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally islook, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. Well, the first thing you do is dont let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. Theyre leaving, and theyre leaving in bigger numbers than ever.And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think youre going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, youre wrong.And once you say youre going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what Im saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And thats a big, big factor. Thats called business, by the way. I did not. I did not. I do not say that. I do not say that. She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one.Now, look, Im a great believer in all forms of energy, but were putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You cant do what youre looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.The Obama administration, from the time theyve come in, is over 230 years worth of debt, and hes topped it. Hes doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because theyre not doing it.And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, theyre gone.And, Hillary, Id just ask you this. Youve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, youve been doing it, and now youre just starting to think of solutions. I will bringexcuse me. I will bring back jobs. You cant bring back jobs. Yeah, for 30 years. Well, he approved NAFTA...[crosstalk] He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country. But you havent done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to... You havent done it. You havent done it. Excuse me. Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I cant win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA. You called it the gold standard.[crosstalk] You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said its the finest deal youve ever seen. And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it. Not. So is it President Obamas fault? Is it President Obamas fault? Secretary, is it President Obamas fault? Because hes pushing it. But you have no plan. Secretary, you have no plan. Thats about all youve...[crosstalk] You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and youre going to increase regulations all over the place.And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. Im very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.When I go aroundLester, I tell you this, Ive been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thingthe things that business as in people like the most is the fact that Im cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.Im going to cut regulations. Im going to cut taxes big league, and youre going to raise taxes big league, end of story. Facts. And take a look at mine, also, and youll see. Well, could I just finishI think I...[crosstalk] I think I shouldyou go to her website, and you take a look at her website. Shes going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion. And look at her website. You know what? Its no difference than this. Shes telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I dont think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much. No, no, youre telling the enemy everything you want to do. See, youre telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder youve been fightingno wonder youve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. Well, Im really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. Theyre going to expand their companies. Theyre going to do a tremendous job.Im getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, its not a taxits really not a great thing for the wealthy. Its a great thing for the middle class. Its a great thing for companies to expand.And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when theyre going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they cant bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton wont allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so whatis so bad.So what theyre doing is theyre leaving our country, and theyre, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they cant work out a deal toand everybody agrees it should be brought back.Instead of that, theyre leaving our country to get their money, because they cant bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they cant get together. Because we havewe have a president that cant sit them around a table and get them to approve something.And heres the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think its double that. Its probably $5 trillion that we cant bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, youd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton. Why not? Theres nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country. Yes. Then you didnt read it. Who gave it that name? The first Ivewho gave it that name?[crosstalk] How much? How much for my family?  Lester, how much? Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesnt work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of whats going on.Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: Were in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, thats going to come crashing down.We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed thats doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing politicalby keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, youre going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton. I dont mind releasingIm under a routine audit. And itll be released. Andas soon as the audits finished, it will be released.But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows incomein fact, the incomeI just looked todaythe income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.But thats the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country thats doing so badly, thats being ripped off by every single country in the world, its the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybodyLester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, whos negotiating these trade deals?We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals. Excuse me. Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, Ive been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year.And in a way, I should be complaining. Im not even complaining. I dont mind it. Its almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people dont.I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returnsagainst my lawyers wisheswhen she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release. [applause]I will release my tax returns. And thats againstmy lawyers, they say, Dont do it. I will tell you this. Noin fact, watching shows, theyre reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you dont release your returns until the audits complete. When the audits complete, Ill do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails. Its not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000... That makes me smart. Thats for sure. That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so theyre not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think its disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks itsreally thinks its disgraceful, also.As far as my tax returns, you dont learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.The other thing, Im extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, thats really not a lot of money. Its not a lot of money relative to what I had.The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which wasactually, it wasnt even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isnt even on that. But its not $650. Its much less than that.But I could give you a list of banks, I wouldif that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. Its because its about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our countrys a mess, you know, its one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everythings in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredibleyou come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you landweve become a third world country.So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and were a mess. We havent even started. And weve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether its 6 or 5, but it looks like its 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.And its really a shame. And its politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. Were a debtor nation. Were a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we dont have the money, because its been squandered on so many of your ideas. It would be squandered, too, believe me. Maybe he didnt do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work... Which our country should do, too. Wrong. Wrong. So, yeah, I thinkI do think its time. Look, its all words, its all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. Its an unbelievable company.But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didnt get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.Now, if you want to change the laws, youve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because Im running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And thats what I do.But what she doesnt say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. Ill give you an example. Were just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I dont get there one way, Im going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.But were opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. Im a year ahead of schedule. And thats what this country should be doing.We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what theyre supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we dont have people that know what theyre doing.When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country. Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesnt want to use a couple of words, and thats law and order. And we need law and order. If we dont have it, were not going to have a country.And when I look at whats going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at whats going on throughout various parts of our country, whether itsI mean, I can just keep naming them all day longwe need law and order in our country.I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we justjust came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, veryI mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because its so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.In Chicago, theyve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And Im saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, overalmost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldnt be having it.We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, theyre illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.We have to bewe have to know what were doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated. No, youre wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where its allowed. No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldnt have them.These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldnt bewhen you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You dont have good community relations in Chicago. Its terrible. I have property there. Its terrible whats going on in Chicago.But when you lookand Chicagos not the onlyyou go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, its not good.But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So theres some bad things going on. Some really bad things. But we needLester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by whats happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And its very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen. Ugh. Id like to respond to that. First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which Im very proud of. These are very, very good people, and theyre protecting the Second Amendment.But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldnt be on there, well help them, well help them legally, well help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And thats a term that I think was aitsits been horribly met, as you know. I think youve apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, youre talking about takes guns away. Well, Im talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I dont thinkI really dont think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.I think maybe theres a political reason why you cant say it, but I really dont believein New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. Its hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. No, youre wrong. Youre wrong. Murders are up. All right. You check it. Id like to just respond, if I might. Id just like to respond. I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, Ill see you in four years.The African-American communitybecauselook, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. Theyve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because thats what it is. Theyve controlled these communities for up to 100 years. And I will tell you, you look at the inner citiesand I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I justyou know, youve seen me, Ive been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and thats OK. But I will tell you, Ive been all over. And Ive met some of the greatest people Ill ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done. Ill tell you verywell, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and closevery close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went toduring the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate.When I got involved, I didnt fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So Im satisfied with it. And Ill tell you why Im satisfied with it. Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country. Yeah. Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured youd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job.Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you knownow, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, thats not true. Look, its true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporteryou just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she cant bring back jobs, she cant produce. Well, it was veryI say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing.But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that Ive developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate. I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesnt work that way. You were after him, you were trying toyou even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I dont think you can deny that.But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesnt work. It really doesnt.Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my fathers company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the countryit was a federal lawsuitwere sued. We settled the suit with zerowith no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I dont do on you. Maybe Im trying to save the money.But, frankly, I lookI look at that, and I say, isnt that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and its just one of those things.Ill go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And its a tremendously successful club. And Im so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And Im very, very proud of it. And thats the way I feel. That is the true way I feel. I do want to say that I was just endorsedand more are coming next weekit will be over 200 admirals, many of them hereadmirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And Im very proud of it.In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. Theyve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed16,500 Border Patrol agents.So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, Ill take the admirals and Ill take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that were in. Look at the mess that were in.As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps were not. I dont think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. Shes saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I dontmaybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?You dont know who broke in to DNC.But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. Thats what we learned.Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we dont know, because the truth is, under President Obama weve lost control of things that we used to have control over.We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, theyre beating us at our own game. ISIS.So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It isit is a huge problem. I have a son. Hes 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, its unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe its hardly doable.But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But thats true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them. Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. We will take out ISIS. Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got outwhat, they shouldnt have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.So she talks about taking them out. Shes been doing it a long time. Shes been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldnt have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldnt have had them.Or, as Ive been saying for a long time, and I think youll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oiland we should have taken the oilISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oila lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Well, I have to respond. The secretary said very strongly about working withweve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyones ever seen. You look at the Middle East, its a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent.But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, thats another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now theyre going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way theyre going.But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, Im a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, Ill tell you. I havent given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them arent paying their fair share. Number twoand that bothers me, because we should be askingwere defending them, and they should at least be paying us what theyre supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, becauseand I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honestbut I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think thats great. And I think we should getbecause we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. Its a lot of money to protect other people. But Im all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.And theyre going to do that. And that wasbelieve meIm sure Im not going to get credit for itbut that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldnt believe it. They sat back probably and said, I cant believe it. They said... No, wait a minute. When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, youre talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now its in over 30 countries. And youre going to stop them? I dont think so. I did not support the war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because shefrankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. Justwould you like to hear... Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out. The record does not show that. The record shows that Im right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyones asked me that, I said, very lightly, I dont know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity saidand he called me the other dayand I spoke to him about ithe said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war. And when heexcuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other peoplehes willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in 04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitelybecause if you read this article, theres no doubt. But if somebodyand Ill ask the pressif somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, its a terrible and a stupid thing. Its going to destabilize the Middle East. And thats exactly what its done. Its been a disaster. No, no. You didnt hear what I said. Well, I have much better judgment than she does. Theres no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? [laughter]I have a much bettershe spentlet me tell youshe spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertisingyou know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put namesoh, temperament, lets go afterI think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a... Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I dont know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, theres a person with a temperament thats got a problem. That would not start a war. No, they were taunting us. Wrong. Its lies. That lines getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to... Its not an accurate one at all. Its not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of thingsand just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and youryour president thinks.Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and were losing a fortune. Thats why were losingwere losingwe lose on everything. I say, who makes thesewe lose on everything. All I said, that its very possible that if they dont pay a fair share, because this isnt 40 years ago where we could do what were doing. We cant defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million... Well, wait, but its very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. Were a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out. As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has. Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, shes very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding theirthey have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint.I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, theyre old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are notwe are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, its over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I cant take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, were doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think Ive ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didnt you do that? Why didnt you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobodys ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.So you say to yourself, why didnt they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they dont have to do much. And theyre going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, hes not a happy camper. Lester, one thing Id like to say. I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, its getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because theyre in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations. And its a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world... ... where theyre not paying us what we need. And she doesnt say that, because shes got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesnt have that. All of the things that shes talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, lets say, while she had great power. But they werent taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they wont be taken care of. She doesnt have the look. She doesnt have the stamina. I said she doesnt have the stamina. And I dont believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina. You havewait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question?You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, thats right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, were defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, were defending them, and theyre not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I dont believe that Hillary has the stamina. The worldlet me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but its bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the lastso shes got experience, that I agree. [applause]But its bad, bad experience. Whether its the Iran deal that youre so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether its the Iran deal, whether its anything you cannameyou almost cant name a good deal. I agree. Shes got experience, but its bad experience. And this country cant afford to have another four years of that kind of experience. I never said that. I didnt say that. Where did you find this? Where did you find this? Where did you find this? Oh, really?  OK, good. Let me just tell you... [applause] You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of its said in entertainment. Some of its saidsomebody whos been very vicious to me, Rosie ODonnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something... ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I cant do it. I just cant do it. Its inappropriate. Its not nice. But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. Theyre untrue. And theyre misrepresentations.And I will tell you this, Lester: Its not nice. And I dont deserve that.But its certainly not a nice thing that shes done. Its hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money... ... $200 million is spent, and Im either winning or tied, and Ive spent practically nothing. [applause] I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. Were losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country.The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they dont even know. Look, heres the story. I want to make America great again. Im going to be able to do it. I dont believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her. [applause]\"\"\",\"\"\" Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Im Lester Holt, anchor of NBC Nightly News. I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonights format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. Well explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; Americas direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, well have an open discussion.The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [applause] Good luck to you. [applause]Well, I dont expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and were going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, lets begin.Were calling this opening segment Achieving Prosperity. And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. Theres been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works? Secretary Clinton, thank you.Mr. Trump, the same question to you. Its about putting moneymore money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes. Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond? Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. Youve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and youve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back? Let me interrupt just a moment, but... Back to the question, though. How do you bring backspecifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back? Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here. Mr. Trump? Very quickly... Folks, were going to... Were going to move to... Let me get you to pause right there, because were going to move intowere going to move into the next segment. Were going to talk taxes... Please just take 30 seconds and then were going to go on. Well, you just opened the next segment. Im going to give you a chance right here... ... with a new 15-minute segment... Mr. Trump, Im going to... The next segment, were continuing... ... achieving prosperity... OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And were still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.Secretary Clinton, youre calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. Id like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, youre calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. Id like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump. All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton. This isthis is Secretary Clintons two minutes, please. Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clintons two minutes. Mr. Trump, were... Mr. Trump, were talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money towho he owes it to and any business conflicts. Dont Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest? The IRS says an audit... ... of your taxesyoure perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the publics right to know outweigh your personal... So its negotiable? Well, Ill let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton? He alsohe also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that? Mr. Trump? Well let you respond and well move on to the next segment. Lets let Mr. Trump... Well, were well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about Americas direction. And lets start by talking about race.The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest its been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as weve seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this. All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide? Your twoyour two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men. The argument is that its a form of racial profiling. Secretary Clinton... Secretary Clinton? Secretary Clinton, last week, you said weve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people? Mr. Trump... Please. This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five... Please20 seconds. Please respond, then Ive got a quick follow-up for you. Mr. Trump, let me...[crosstalk] Mr. Trump, I... Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nations first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long? That was...[crosstalk] I will let you respond. Its important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. Youve continued to tell the story and question the presidents legitimacy in 2012, 13, 14, 15... .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind? Im sorry. Im just going to follow upand I will let you respond to that, because theres a lot there. But were talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who...[crosstalk] Secretary Clinton? Mr. Trump, you can respond and were going to move on to the next segment. Our next segment is called Securing America. We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, whos behind it? And how do we fight it?Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you. Your two minutes have expired. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Whos behind it? And how do we fight it? Secretary Clinton? You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. Ill ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump? Secretary Clinton? Mr. Trump... Please respond.  Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your... In 2002... My question is, since you supported it... ... why is yourwhy is your judgment... The record shows otherwise, but whywhy was... Why wasis your judgment any... Why is your judgment better than... My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was... Why is your judgmentwhy is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clintons judgment? Secretary Clinton? Secretary Clinton? We need to move on. Our last... Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here on the, still on the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nations longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that. Your two minutes is expired. All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. Your two minutes is... ... is expired. Very quickly. Twenty seconds. Mr. Trump... We have just... We have just a few final questions... Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesnt have, quote, a presidential look. Shes standing here right now. What did you mean by that? The quote was, I just dont think she has the presidential look. Lets let her respond.  We are atwe are at the final question. [applause] Very quickly, because were at the final question now. Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question... Please very quickly. We have to move on to the final question. One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton? Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters?  Will you accept the outcome of the election? All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.A reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight. Good night, everyone.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 22 2012,The President,Governor Romney,\"\"\" Thank you, Bob. And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening. Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here. And, Mr. President, its good to be with you again. We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and its nice to maybe be funny this time, not on purpose. Well see what happens. This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world and to America in particular, which is to see a complete change in the structure and the environment in the Middle East. With the Arab Spring came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, an opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life and in economic life in the Middle East. But instead, weve seen in nation after nation a number of disturbing events. Of course, we see in Syria 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. We see in Libya, an attack, apparently byI think we know nowby terrorists of some kind against our people there, four people dead. Our hearts and minds go to them. Mali has been taken overthe northern part of Maliby Al Qaida-type individuals. We have in Egypt a Muslim Brotherhood President. And so what were seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region. Of course, the greatest threat of all is Iran, 4 years closer to a nuclear weapon. And were going to have to recognize that we have to do as the President has done; I congratulate him on taking out Usama bin Laden and going after the leadership in Al Qaida. But we cant kill our way out of this mess. Were going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the world of Islam and other parts of the world reject this radical, violent extremism, which isits certainly not on the run. Its certainly not hiding. This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries. And it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.  Well, my first job as Commander in Chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe. And thats what weve done over the last 4 years. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. And as a consequence, Al Qaidas core leadership has been decimated. In addition, were now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security. And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats. Now, with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harms way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened; and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice. And thats exactly what were going to do. But I think its important to step back and think about what happened in Libya. Now, keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able towithout putting troops on the ground, at the cost of less than what we spent in 2 weeks in Iraqliberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years, got rid of a despot who had killed Americans. And as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans, after the events in Benghazi, marching and saying: America is our friend. We stand with them. Now, that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of. And, Governor Romney, Im glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.  Governor Romney, Im glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago, when you were asked whats the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia. Not Al Qaida, you said Russia. And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because the cold war has been over for 20 years. But, Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s, and the economic policies of the 1920s. You say that youre not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq, but just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now. And the challenge we haveI know you havent been in a position to actually execute foreign policy, but every time youve offered an opinion, youve been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day. You indicated that we shouldnt be passing nuclear treaties with Russia, despite the fact that 71 SenatorsDemocrats and Republicansvoted for it. Youve said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan; then, you said we should; now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing and sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies. So what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map. And unfortunately, thats the kinds of opinions that youve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength or keeping America safe over the long term.  Number-one geopolitical foe.  Thats not true.  No, what I would not have done is left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down. That certainly would not help us in the Middle East.  Here is  Here is  Governor  Governor  This is just a few weeks ago.  This is just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.  You made a major speech.  Governor  Governor, heres one thing  Heres one thing Ive learned as Commander in Chief. Youve got to be clear both to our allies and our enemies about where you stand and what you mean. Now, you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East. Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just beat these challenges militarily. And so what Ive donethroughout my Presidency and will continue to dois, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts. Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israels security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region. Number three, we do have to make sure that were protecting religious minorities and women because these countries cant develop unless all the populationnot just half of itis developing. Number four, we do have to develop their economic capabilities. But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we cant continue to do nation-building in these regions. Part of American leadership is making sure that were doing nation-building here at home. . That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.  What weve done is organize the international community, saying Asad has to go. Weve mobilized sanctions against that Government. We have made sure that they are isolated. We have provided humanitarian assistance, and we are helping the opposition organize. And were particularly interested in making sure that were mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria. But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future. And so everything were doing, were doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel, which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria, coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. Now, what were seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking. And thats why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition. But we also have to recognize that for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step. And we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping, that were not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or our allies in the region. And I am confident that Asads days are numbered. But what we cant do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.  Bob, we are playing the leadership role. We organized the Friends of Syria. We are mobilizing humanitarian support and support for the opposition. And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. But going back to Libya, because this is an example of how we make choices: When we went into Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize, we also had to make sure that Muammar Qaddafi didnt stay there. And to the Governors credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized. But when it came time to making sure that Qaddafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle. Imagine if we had pulled out at that point. Muammar Qaddafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Usama bin Laden, and so we were going to make sure that we finished the job. Thats part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us. But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with. And we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria. Thats exactly what were doing.  Ill be very quick. What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesnt have different ideas, and thats because were doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and an effective transition so that we get Asad out. Thats the kind of leadership weve shown. Thats the kind of leadership well continue to show.  Right.  No, I dont, because I think that America has to stand with democracy. The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago. But what Ive also said is that now that you have a democratically elected Government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minoritiesand we have put significant pressure on them to make sure theyre doing thatto recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region. These countries cant develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need. They have to abide by their treaty with Israel. That is a red line for us, because not only is Israels security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. They have to make sure that theyre cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism. And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately, whats going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities. Their aspirations are similar to young peoples here. They want jobs. They want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school. They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future. And so one of the things that weve been doing is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way thats noncorrupt, thats transparent. But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region, there are some things that were going to have to do here at home as well. One of the challenges over the last decade is weve done experiments in nation-building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, and weve neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system. And its very hard for us to project leadership around the world when were not doing what we need to do here.  Bob, I think  America remains the one indispensible nation. And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office. Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade. And, Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat. But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America. And thats what my plan does: making sure that were bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that were creating jobs here, as weve done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas; making sure that weve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. Doing everything we can to control our own energy. Weve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because weve developed oil and natural gas, but we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020. Thats the kind of leadership that we need to show. And weve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit. Unfortunately, Governor Romneys plan doesnt do it. Weve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we dont need, but also by asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology thats always kept us at the cutting edge. Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign. Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies. Hes praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who hasshows great wisdom and judgment. And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.  Well, lets talk about what we need to compete. First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses, but, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think, out of 50 States in Massachusetts because the policies that youre promoting actually dont help small businesses. And the way you define small businesses include folks at the very top; they include you and me. Thats not the kind of small business promotion we need. But lets take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century, and thats our education policy. We didnt have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate. Under my leadership, what weve done is reformed education, working with Governors, 46 States. Weve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time, and theyre starting to finally make progress. And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that weve fallen behind when it comes to math and science. And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isnt going to help the economy grow. When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes dont make a difference. But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference. And if weve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, thats whats going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here. Companies are going to locate here depending on whether weve got the most highly skilled workforce. And the kinds of budget proposals that youve put forward, when we dont ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, thats undermining our long-term competitiveness. That is not good for Americas position in the world, and the world notices.  Ten years earlier, Governor.  But that was 10 years before you took office.  And then you cut education spending when you came into office.  That happened before you came into office though.  Bob  Bob  But he should have answered the first question. Look, Governor Romney has called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says hes going to pay for by closing deductions. Now, the math doesnt work, but he continues to claim that hes going to do it. He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for. Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that Ive been in office. We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combinedChina, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name itnext 10. And what I did was work with our Joint Chiefs of Staff to think about what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe, and thats the budget that weve put forward. But what you cant do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts. You say that youre going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions without naming what those loopholes and deductions are, and then somehow, youre also going to deal with the deficit that weve already got. The math simply doesnt work. But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not just budgets. Weve got think about capabilities. We need to be thinking about cybersecurity. We need to be thinking about space. Thats exactly what our budget does, but its driven by strategy. Its not driven by politics. Its not driven by Members of Congress and what they would like to see. Its driven by what are we going to need to keep the American people safe. Thats exactly what our budget does. And it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern, because weve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.  Bob, I just need to comment on this. First of all, the sequester is not something that I proposed. Its something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen. The budget that were talking about is not reducing our military spending, its maintaining it. And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home. And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that youre putting forward, because it just doesnt work.  And we visited the web site quite a bit, and it still doesnt work. [Laughter]  First of all, Israel is a true friend; it is our greatest ally in the region. And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel. Ive made that clear throughout my Presidency.  I will stand with Israel if they are attacked. And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history. In fact, this week, well be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in historythis very week. But to the issue of Iran, as long as Im President of the United States, Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. I made that clear when I came into office. We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy. Their currency has dropped 80 percent. Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago. So their economy is in a shambles. And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and its a threat to Israels national security. We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world. Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, and for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to nonstate actors, thats unacceptable. And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map. So the work that weve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice: They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program, or they will have to face a united world and a United States Presidentmewho said were not going to take any options off the table. The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign, hes often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake, because when Ive sent young men and women into harms way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.  Well, first of all, those are reports in the newspaper. They are not true. But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place. Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations. And we would welcome that. There are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life. And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision. But the deal well accept is, they end their nuclear program. Its very straightforward. And Im glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that were taking. There have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign where it sounded like you thought that youd do the same things we did, but youd say them louder, and somehow, that would make a difference. And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking. Its meticulous. We started from the day we got into office. And the reason it was so importantand this is a testament to how weve restored American credibility and strength around the worldis we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China, because if its just us that are imposing sanctions, weve had sanctions in place for a long time. Its because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure. And weve got to maintain that pressure. There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established, they convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program, there are inspections that are very intrusive, but over time what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, were not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. And one last thing, just to make this point: The clock is ticking. Were not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere. And Ive been very clear to them. Because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program. And that clock is ticking.  And were going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they dont have a nuclear weapon.  Bob, let me just respond. Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing. This has been probably the biggest whopper thats been told during the course of this campaign. And every fact-checker and every reporter whos looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true. And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, weve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector. So Ill let the American people decide, judge who is going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions. And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place, and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for. And so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that weve been able to mobilize the world. When I came into office, the world was divided; Iran was resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point economically, strategically, militarily than sincethan in many years. And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. Thats in Americas national interest, and that will be the case so long as Im President.  Bob, let me respond. If were going to talk about trips that weve taken, when I was a candidate for office, the first trip I took was to visit our troops. And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didnt take donors, I didnt attend fundraisers. I went to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable. And then I went down to the border towns of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas. And I saw families there who showed me where missiles had come down near their childrens bedrooms, and I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids, which is why, as President, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles. So thats how Ive used my travels, when I traveled to Israel and when I traveled to the region. And the central question at this point is going to be whos going to be credible to all parties involved. And they can look at my track recordwhether its Irans sanctions, whether its dealing with counterterrorism, whether its supporting democracy, whether its supporting womens rights, whether its supporting religious minoritiesand they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history. And that kind of credibility is precisely why weve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.  The  Bob  Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issueswhether its the Middle East, whether its Afghanistan, whether its Iraq, whether its now Iranyouve been all over the map. I mean, Im pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago, you said thats something youd never do. In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now youre for it, although it depends. In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there. The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Qaddafi. When it comes to going after Usama bin Laden, you said, well, any President would make that call. But when you were a candidate in 2008as I wasand I said if I got bin Laden in our sights, I would take that shot, you said we shouldnt move heaven and earth to get one man. And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission. And if we had asked Pakistan for permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him. After we killed bin Laden, I was at Ground Zero for a memorial and talked to a young woman who was 4 years old when 9/11 happened. And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the Twin Towers, saying, Payton, I love you, and I will always watch over you. And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation. And she said to me, By finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me. And when we do things like that, when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world, and it tells Payton that we did not forget her father.  And I make that point because thats the kind of clarity of leadershipand those decisions are not always popular. Those decisions generally are not poll tested. And even some in my own party, including my current Vice President, had the same critique as you did. But what the American people understand is, is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.  Well agree on that.  When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq, and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade. We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops. That was facilitated, in part, because we had ended the war in Iraq. And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place. Part of what had happened is we had forgotten why we had gone. We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths. And so we decimated Al Qaidas core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. We then started to build up Afghan forces, and were now in a position where we can transition out, because theres no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country. Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. Weve been there a long time, and weve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need. But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war, its time to do some nation-building here at home. And what we can now do is free up some resources to, for example, put Americans back to workespecially our veteransrebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools; making sure that our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury; making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place. I was having lunch with somea veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances. When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what weve said is, lets change those certifications. The First Lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces, putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans unemployment is actually now lower than the general population; it was higher when I came into office. So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because were making that transition in Afghanistan.  Well, keep in mind, our strategy wasnt just going after bin Laden. Weve created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism: in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan. And what weve also done is engage these Governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in peoples lives day to day: to make sure that their Governments arent corrupt; to make sure that they are treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown; and to make sure that theyve got a free market system that works. So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries, and we have stood on the side of democracy. One thing I think Americans should be proud ofwhen Tunisians began to protest, this Nationme, my administrationstood with them earlier than just about any other country. In Egypt, we stood on the side of democracy. In Libya, we stood on the side of the people. And as a consequence, theres no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed. But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States, and we want to shrink those groups and those networks, and we can do that. But were always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities. The truth, though, is that Al Qaida is much weaker than it was when I came into office, and they dont have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did 4 years ago.  Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks. We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary but also a potential partner in the international community if its following the rules. So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else. Now, I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas, businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade. And thats the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade. Thats the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the otherthe previous administration had done in two terms. And weve won just about every case that we filed, that has been decided. In fact, just recently, steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest, Pennsylvania, are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case. We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tiresor cheap Chinese tires, and we put a stop to it and, as a consequence, saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case, said this wouldnt be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist. But I tell you, those workers dont feel that way. They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously. Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, weve also got to make sure, though, that were taking care of business here at home. If we dont have the best education system in the world, if we dont continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, thats how we lose the competition. And unfortunately, Governor Romneys budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.  Well, Governor Romney is right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas. And thats your right. I mean, thats how our free market works. But Ive made a different bet on American workers. If we had taken your advice, Governor Romney, about our auto industry, wed be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China. If we take your advice with respect to how we change our Tax Code so that companies that are in profits overseas dont pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes, thats estimated to create 800,000 jobs. The problem is they wont be here, theyll be in places like China. And if were not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the lead in things like clean energy technology. Now, with respect to what weve done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled, since I came into office, to China. And actually, currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993. We absolutely have to make more progress, and thats why were going to keep on pressing. And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future. And we believe China can be a partner, but were also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power, that we are going to have a presence there. We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through, that commerce continues. And were organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards. Thats the kind of leadership weve shown in the region. Thats the kind of leadership that well continue to show.  Governor Romney, thats not what you said.  Governor Romney, you did not say that you would provide governor help.  Lets check the record.  Lets check the record.  Governor, the people of Detroit dont forget.  Governor, the fact of the matter is  .Governor, Im happy to respond. Youve held the floor for a while.  Look, I think anybody out there can check the record. Governor Romney, you keep on trying to airbrush history here. You were very clear that you would not provide Government assistance to the U.S. auto companies even if they went through bankruptcy. You said that they could get it in the private marketplace. That wasnt true. They would have gone through  No, I am not wrong.  I am not wrong.  People will look it up.  But more importantly, it is true that in order for us to be competitive, were going to have to make some smart choices right now. Cutting our education budget, thats not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China. Cutting our investments in research and technology, thats not a smart choice. That will not help us compete with China. Bringing down our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive. Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now. Having a Tax Code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive. And the one thing that Im absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw a drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, weve now begun to make some real progress. What we cant do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place. And thats why we have to move forward and not go back.  Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University. And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies: a foreign policy thats wrong and reckless; economic policies that wont create jobs, wont reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top dont have to play by the same rules that you do. And Ive got a different vision for America. I want to build on our strengths. And Ive put forward a plan to make sure that were bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas. I want to make sure weve got the best education system in the world, and were retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas, but also the energy sources of the future. Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we dont need, but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st-century economy. As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops, and go after those who would do us harm. But after a decade of war, I think we all recognize weve got to do some nation-building here at home rebuilding our roads, our bridges, and especially caring for our veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom. Weve been through tough times, but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together. And if I have the privilege of being your President for another 4 years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices, I will fight for your families, and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you. . Thats great. \"\"\",\"\"\"Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to kill them, to take them out of the picture. But my strategy is broader than that. Thats important, of course. But the key that were going to have to pursue is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. We dont want another Iraq. We dont want another Afghanistan. Thats not the right course for us. The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. And how do we do that? The group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the world reject these terrorists. And the answer they came up with was this: one, more economic development. We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investmentand that of our friends, we should coordinate itto make sure that we push back and give them more economic development. Number two, better education. Number three, gender equality. Number four, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies. But whats been happening over the last couple of years is, as weve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in. You see other jihadist groups rushing in. And theyre throughout many nations in the Middle East. Its wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy. But next door, of course, we have Egypt; Libya is 6 million population, Egypt 80 million population. We want to make sure that were seeing progress throughout the Middle East, with Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida, with Syria having Asad continuing to assassinate, to kill, to murder his own people. This is a region in tumult.  And of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon. Weve got real problems in the region. Well, of course, I dont concur with what the President said about my own record and the things that Ive said. They dont happen to be accurate. But I can say this: that were talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism were seeing and the rising tide of tumult and confusion. And attacking me is not an agenda. Attacking me is not talking about how were going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East and take advantage of the opportunity there and stem the tide of this violence. But Ill respond to a couple of the things you mentioned. First of all, Russia, I indicated, is a geopolitical foe, not a Excuse me. Its a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same paragraph, I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face. Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. I have clear eyes on this. Im not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin. And Im certainly not going to say to him, Ill give you more flexibility after the election. After the election, hell get more backbone. Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed, I believe, that there should have been a status of forces agreement. Did you Oh, you didnt? You didnt want a status of forces agreement? Im sorry. You actuallythere was an effort on the part of the President to have a status of forces agreement And I concurred in that and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on. That was something I concurred with. That was your posture. That was my posture as well. You thought it should have been 5,000 troops. I thought it should have been more troops. But you know what, the answer was we got no troops through whatsoever. No, I didnt. Im sorry, thats I indicated that you failed to put in place a status of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed in Iraq. Well, lets step back and talk about whats happening in Syria and how important it is. First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their Government is a humanitarian disaster. Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now. Syria is Irans only ally in the Arab world. Its their route to the sea. Its the route for them to arm Hizballah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel. And so seeing Syria remove Asad is a very high priority for us. Number two, seeing a replacement Government being responsible people is critical for us. And finally, we dont want to have military involvement there. We dont want to get drawn in to a military conflict. And so the right course for us is working through our partners and with our own resources to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a form of, if not government, a form of council that can take the lead in Syria, and then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they dont have arms that get into the wrong hands, that those arms could be used to hurt us down the road. We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies and particularly with Israel. But the Saudis and the Qatari and the Turks are all very concerned about this. Theyre willing to work with us. We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the insurgents there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize, I believe that Asad must go. I believe he will go. But I believe we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place such that in the years to come, we see Syria as a friend and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East. This is a critical opportunity for America. And what Im afraid of is, what weve watched over the past year or so, first, the President saying, well, well let the U.N. deal with it, and Asadexcuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said were going to try to have a cease-fire. That didnt work. Then it looked to the Russians and said, lets see if you can do something. We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military, but play the leadership role. I dont want to have our military involved in Syria. I dont think theres a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage. I dont anticipate that in the future. As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Asad and to have in place a new Government, which is friendly to us, a responsible Government, if possible. And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove Asad. But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our troops. And this isnt going to be necessary. We havewith our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups. But look, this has been going on for a year. This is a timethis should have been a time for American leadership. We should have taken a leading rolenot militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentallyto bring together the parties there, to find responsible parties. As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the insurgents are highly disparate; they havent come together; they havent formed a unity group, a council of some kind. That needs to happen. America can help that happen. And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role, which is getting rid of Asad. No. I believe as the President indicated and said at the time that I supported his action there. I felt thatI wish wed have had a better vision of the future. I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the Presidents term and even further back than that, that wed have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didnt explode in the way it did. But once it exploded, I felt the same as the President did, which is, these freedom voices in the streets of Egypt were the people who were speaking of our principles. And President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable, and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is moreis peaceful. We want a peaceful planet. We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know theyre going to have a bright and prosperous future and not be at war. Thats our purpose. And the mantle of leadership for the promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didnt ask for it, but its an honor that we have it. But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong, and that begins with a strong economy here at home. And unfortunately, the economy is not stronger. When the President of Iraqexcuse me, of Iran, Ahmadi-nejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, thats a frightening thing. The former chief of staffchief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said thatAdmiral Mullensaid that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face. Thiswe have weakened our economy. We need a strong economy. We need to have, as well, a strong military. Our military is second to none in the world. Were blessed with terrific soldiers and extraordinary technology and intelligence. But the idea of a trillion dollars in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies. Our association and connection with our allies is essential to Americas strength. Were the great nation that has allies: 42 allies and friends around the world. And finally we have to stand by our principles. And if were strong in each of those things, American influence will grow. But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is Americas influence greater today than it was 4 years ago. And thats because weve become weaker on each of those four dimensions. Well, I absolutely believe that America has a responsibility and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that make the world more peaceful, and those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections, because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace. They dont vote for war. So we want to promote those principles around the world. We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible. But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong. America must lead. And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home. You cant have 23 million people struggling to get a job. You cant have an economy that, over the last 3 years, keeps slowing down in its growth rate. You cant have kids coming out of college, half of whom cant find a job today or a job thats commensurate with their college degree. We have to get our economy going. And our military: Weve got to strengthen our military long term. We dont know what the world is going to throw at us down the road. We make decisions today in a military that will confront challenges we cant imagine. In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance. And a year later, 9/11 happened. So we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military. I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies. I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate. I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. And then of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when the students took the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred. For the President to be silent, I thought was an enormous mistake. We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy. Ive got a policy for the future and an agenda for the future. And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay. And what weve seen over the last 4 years is something I dont want to see over the next 4 years. The President said by now wed be at 5.4 percent unemployment. Were 9 million jobs short of that. I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and Ill do it with five simple steps. Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence. Were going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear, and our renewables. Number two, were going to increase our trade. Trade grows about 12 percent per year. It doubles about every 5 or so years. We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America. The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully. As a matter of fact, Latin Americas economy is almost as big as the economy of China. Were all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us: time zone, language opportunities. Number three, were going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers unions going to have to go behind. And then, were going to have to get to a balanced budget. We cant expect entrepreneurs and businesses, large and small, to take their life savings or their companys money and invest in America if they think were headed to the road to Greece. And thats where were going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge. And Ill get us on track to a balanced budget. And finally, number five, weve got to champion small business. Small businesses are where jobs come from. Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses. New business formation is down at the lowest level in 30 years under this administration. I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay. Well, look Well, I need to speak a moment if youll let me, Bob just about education, because Im so proud of the State that I had the chance to be Governor of. We have, every 2 years, tests that look at how well our kids are doing. Fourth-graders and eighth-graders are tested in English and math. While I was Governor, I was proud that our fourth-graders came out number one of all 50 States in English and then also in math, and our eighth-graders number one in English and also in math. First time one State had been number one in all four measures. How did we do that? Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom, and that was and that was what allowed us to become the number-one State in the Nation. And this isand we were Absolutely The firstand we kept our schools number one in the Nation. Theyre still number one today. And the principles that we put in placewe also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to be able to compete, but also if they graduated in the top quarter of their class, they got a 4-year, tuition-free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning. That was actually mine. Actually, Mr. President, youve got that fact wrong. Well, lets come back and talk about the military, but all the way through. First of all, Im going through from the very beginning, were going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military. Thats number one, all right? And thats The good news isIll be happy to have you take a look. Come on our web site; youll look at how we get to a balanced budget within 8 to 10 years. We do it by gettingby reducing spending in a whole series of programs. By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare. There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just cant afford them, and that one doesnt sound good, and its not affordable. So I get rid of that one from day one. To the extent humanly possible, we get that out. We take program after program that we dont absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them. Number two, we take some programs that we are going to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor, we take that health care program for the poor, and we give it to the States to run because States run these programs more efficiently. As a Governor, I thought, please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the Federal Government. And States, by the way, are proving it. States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these Medicaid dollars, have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively. And so I want to do those two things. It gets us to a balanced budget within 8 to 10 years. Lets get back to the military though. Bob, Im pleased that Ive balanced budgets. I was in the world of business for 25 years. You didnt balance your budget, you went out of business. I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance and made a success there. I had the chance to be Governor of a State; 4 years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget. We cut taxes 19 times, balanced our budget. The President hasnt balanced a budget yet. I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself. Im going to be able to balance the budget. Lets talk about military spending, and thats this: Our Navy Our Navy is olderexcuse me, our Navy is smaller now than any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission; were now down to 285. Were headed down to the low two-hundreds if we go through with sequestration. Thats unacceptable to me. I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy. Our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since it was founded in 1947. Weve changed for the first time since FDR; since FDR, we had theweve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once. Now were changing to one conflict. Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people. And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is the combination of the budget cuts that the President has, as well as the sequestration cuts. That, in my view, is making our future less certain and less secure Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the President made, which is that if Im President of the United Stateswhen Im President of the United Stateswe will stand with Israel. And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily. Thats number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, theres no question but that a nuclear Irana nuclear-capable Iranis unacceptable to America. It presents a threat not only to our friends, but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us. Its also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means. And crippling sanctions are something I called for 5 years ago. When I was in Israel speaking at the Herzliya conference, I laid out seven steps. Crippling sanctions were number one, and they do work. Youre seeing it right now in the economy. Its absolutely the right thing to do to have crippling sanctions. Id have put them in place earlier, but its good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions. I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil cant come into our ports. I imagine the EU would agree with us as well. Not only ships couldnt, Id say companies that are moving their oil cant; people who are trading in their oil cant. I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, Id take on diplomatic isolation efforts. Id make sure that Ahmadi-nejad is indicted under the genocide convention. His words amount to genocide incitation. I would indict him for it. I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world, the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa. We need to increase pressure time and time again on Iran, because anything other than a solution to this which sayswhich stops this nuclear folly of theirs is unacceptable to America. And of course, a military action is the last resort. It is something one would only, only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent. I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges weve had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be. I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength. And I say that because from the very beginning, the President, in his campaign some 4 years ago, said hed meet with all the worlds worst actors in his first year. Hed sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong Il, with Castro, and with President Ahmadi-nejad of Iran. And I think they looked and thought, well, thats an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States. And then the President began what Ive called an apology tour of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America. I think they looked at that and saw weakness. Then, when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the President was silent. I think they noticed that as well. And I think that when the President said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well. All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, but were just going to keep on spinning centrifuges. Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world. Thats unacceptable for us. And its essential for a President to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable. And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us. They must not develop nuclear capability. And the way to make sure they understand that is by having from the very beginning the tightest sanctions possible. They need to be tightened. Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher. We need to indict Ahmadi-nejad. We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can. Because if we do that, we wont have to take the military action. Were 4 years closer to a nuclear Iran. Were 4 years closer to a nuclear Iran. And we should not have wasted these 4 years to the extent theyve continued to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer. Thats number one. Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East, and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq, and by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region. But you went to the other nations. And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel. And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive. You said that on occasion America has dictated to other nations. Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictators. Bob, its notlets not go into hypotheticals of that nature. Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the Prime Minister of Israel, is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way or their fighters are on the way. This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of last-minute Im just saying thats just not But let me  lets come back to what the President was speaking about, which is whats happening in the world and the Presidents statement that things are going so well. Look, I look at whats happening around the world, and I see Iran 4 years closer to a bomb. I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult. I see jihadists continuing to spread; whether theyre rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but thisits clear theyre there. Theyre very strong. I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead. Asad still in power. I see our trade deficit with China larger than itsgrowing larger every year, as a matter of fact. I look around the world, and I dont feel thatyou see North Korea continuing to export their nuclear technology. Russia has said theyre not going to follow Nunn-Lugar anymore. Theyreback away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them. I look around the world, I dont see our influence growing around the world. I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the President to deal with our economic challenges at home, in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way, I think, it ought to be; in part because of the turmoil with Israel. I mean, the President received a letter from 38 Democrat Senators saying that tensions  with Israel were a real problem. They asked him, please repair the tensionDemocrat Senatorsplease repair the damage in his own party. Bob Well, thats probably true. [Laughter] Well, were going to be finished by 2014. And when Im President, well make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014. The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so. Weve seen progress over the past several years. The surge has been successful, and the training program is proceeding apace. There are now a large number of Afghan security forces, 350,000, that are ready to step in to provide security, and were going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point. I can tell you at the same time that we will make sure that we look at whats happening in Pakistan and recognize that whats happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan. And I say that because I know a lot of people just feel like we should brush our hands and walk awayand I dont mean you, Mr. Presidentbut some people in our Nation feel that Pakistan isnt being nice to us and that we should just walk away from them. Pakistan is important to the region, to the world, and to us, because Pakistan has a hundred nuclear warheads and theyre rushing to build a lot more. Theyll have more than Great Britain sometime in the relatively near future. They also have the Haqqani network and the Taliban existent within their country. And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us. And so were going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild a relationship with us. And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met. So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014. No, its not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has a hundred nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, the Haqqani network. Its a nation thats not like others, and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there. Youve got the ISI, their intelligence organization, thats probably the most powerful of three branches there. Then you have the military, and then you have the civilian Government. This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there, and youve got terrorists there who could grab their hands onto those nuclear weapons. This is an important part of the world for us. Pakistan is technically an ally, and theyre not acting very much like an ally right now, but we have some work to do. And I dont blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained. We had to go into Pakistan. We had to go in there to get Usama bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. And that upset them, but there was obviously a great deal of anger even before that. But were going to have to work with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that theyre on. Its important for them. Its important for the nuclear weapons. Its important for the success of Afghanistan, because inside Pakistan you have a large group of Pashtuns that are Taliban. Theyre going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go, and thats one of the reasons the Afghan security forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that. But its important for us to recognize that we cant just walk away from Pakistan. But we do need to make sure that as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society. Well, I believe that we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world. And its widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that entirely, and feel the President was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it to continue to go after the people who represent a threat to this Nation and to our friends. Let me also note that, as I said earlier, were going to have to do more than just going after leaders and killing bad guys, important as that is. Were also going to have to have a far more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism. We havent done that yet. We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the record. You look at the record of the last 4 years and say, is Iran closer to a bomb? Yes. Is the Middle East in tumult? Yes. Is al Qaeda on the run, on its heels? No. Isare Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement? No, they havent had talks in 2 years. We have not seen the progress we need to have. And Im convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands. Well, first of all, its not government that makes business successful. Its not government investments that make businesses grow and hire people. Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran. Lets talk about China. China has an interest thats very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world. They dont want war. They dont want to see protectionism. They dont want to see the world break out into various forms of chaos, because they have to manufacture goods and put people to work. They have about 20,00020 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year, coming into the cities, needing jobs. So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open. And so we can be a partner with China. We dont have to be an adversary in any way, shape, or form. We can work with them. We can collaborate with them, if theyre willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, is it a good idea to be with America? How strong are we going to be? How strong is our economy? They look at the fact that we owe them a trillion dollars and owe other people 16 trillion in total, including them. They look at our decision to cut back on our military capabilities: a trillion dollars. The Secretary of Defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating. Its not my term. Its the Presidents own Secretary of Defense called them devastating. They look at Americas commitments around the world, and they see whats happening, and they say, well, okay, is America going to be strong? And the answer is yes; if Im President, America will be very strong. Well also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us. Ive watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency; it holds down the prices of their goods. It means our goods arent as competitive, and we lose jobs. Thats got to end. Theyre making some progress. They need to make more. Thats why on day one I will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where theyre taking jobs. Theyre stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. They have to understand, we want to trade with them, we want a world thats stable, we like free enterprise, but youve got to play by the rules. Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year. So its pretty clear who doesnt want a trade war. And theres one going on right now which we dont know about; its a silent one, and theyre winning. We have enormous trade imbalance with China. And its worse this year than last year. And its worst last year than the year before. And so we have to understand that we cant just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out. We have to say to our friends in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively, we understand it, but this cant keep on going. You cant keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even into the United States. I was with one company that makes valves in process industries. And they said, look, we were having some valves coming in that were broken, and we had to repair them under warranty. And we looked them up, and they had our serial number on them, and then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number. There were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging. These were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor. This cant go on. I want a great relationship with China. China can be our partner, but that doesnt mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis. I just want to take one of those points. Again, attacking me is not talking about an agenda for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country. But the President mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere. Nothing could be further from the truth. Im a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars, and I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet, when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks. It was President Bush that wrote the first checks. I disagreed with that. I said they needthese companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And in that process, they can get Government help and Government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that theyd built up. And fortunately, the President took Fortunately, the Presidentyou can take a look at the op-ed. You can take a look at the op-ed. You know, Im still speaking. I said that we would provide guarantees, and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy. Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet. And the idea that has been suggested, that I would liquidate the industry, of course not, of course not. Thats the height of silliness. I have never said I would liquidate the industry. I want to keep the industry going and thriving. And thats why I have the kind of commitment to make sure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful. We in this country can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and were going to. Were going to have to have a President, however, that doesnt think that somehow the Government investing in car companies like Tesla and Fisker, making electric battery cars, this is not research, Mr. President. These are the government investing in companies, investing in Solyndra. This is a company; this isnt basic research. I want to invest in research. Research is great. Providing funding to universities and think tanks, great. But investing in companies, absolutely not. Thats the wrong way to go. Im still speaking. So I want to make sure that we make America more competitive and that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow. But your investing in companies doesnt do that. In fact, it makes it less likely for them to come here, because the private sector is not going to invest in a solar company if youre investing Government money in someone elses. Youre wrong. Youre wrong, Mr. President. Youre wrong. People can look it up, youre right. Good. I couldnt agree more about going forward, but I certainly dont want to go back to the policies of the last 4 years. The policies of the last 4 years has seen incomes in America decline every year for middle-income families, now down $4,300 during your term. Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job. When you came to office, 32 million people on food stamps; today, 47 million people on food stamps. When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt; now $16 trillion in debt. It hasnt worked. You said by now wed be at 5.4 percent unemployment. Were 9 million jobs short of that. Ive met some of those people. I met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. I met a young woman in Philadelphia whos coming out of college, cant find work. Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work. Its just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last 4 years have been so hard. And thats why its so critical that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy. And thats not going to happen by just hiring teachers. Look, Id love toI love teachers, and Im happy to have States and communities that want to hire teachers do that. By the way, I dont like to have the Federal Government start pushing its way deeper and deeper into our schools; let the States and localities do that. I was a Governor; the Federal Government didnt hire our teachers. But I love teachers, but I want to get our private sector growing, and I know how to do it. Thank you. Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you. Im optimistic about the future. Im excited about our prospects as a nation. I want to see peace. I want to see growing peace in this country. Its our objective. We have an opportunity to have real leadership. America is going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace that will make the world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure. I also to want to make sure that we get this economy going. And there are two very different paths the country can take. One is a path represented by the President, which, at the end of 4 years, would mean wed have $20 trillion in debt, heading towards Greece. Ill get us on track to a balanced budget. The Presidents path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay. I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow. The Presidents path means 20 million people out of work, struggling for a good job. Ill get people back to work with 12 million new jobs. Im going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs. America is going to come back, and for that to happen, were going to have to have a President who can work across the aisle. I was in a State where my legislature was 87-percent Democrat. I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle. Weve got to do that in Washington. Washington is broken. I know what it takes to get this country back, and well work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that. This Nation is the hope of the Earth. Weve been blessed by having a nation thats free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation. Theyve held a torch for the world to see, a torch of freedom and hope and opportunity. Now its our turn to take that torch. Im convinced well do it. We need strong leadership. Id like to be that leader, with your support. Ill work with you. Ill lead you in an open and honest way. And I ask for your vote. Id like to be the next President of the United States to support and help this great Nation, and to make sure that we all together maintain America as the hope of the Earth. Thank you so much. \"\"\",\"\"\"The questions are mine, and I have not shared them with the candidates or their aides. The audience has taken a vow of silence: no applause, no reaction of any kind, except right now, when we welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney. Theyve asked me to divide the evening into segments. Ill pose a question at the beginning of each segment. Youll each have 2 minutes to respond, and then, we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment. Tonights debate, as both of you know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that President Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba, perhaps the closest weve ever come to nuclear war. And it is a sobering reminder that every President faces, at some point, an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad. So lets begin. The first segment is the challenge of a changing Middle East and the new face of terrorism. Im going to put this into two segments, so youll have two topic questions within this one segment on that subject. The first question, and it concerns Libya. The controversy over what happened there continues. Four Americans are dead, including an American Ambassador. Questions remain of what happened: What caused it? Was it spontaneous? Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened? Governor Romney, you said this was an example of an American policy in the Middle East that is unraveling before our very eyes. Id like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that. Governor Romney, you won the toss; you go first. Mr. President.  Well, lets see what the Well get to that. But lets give the President a chance. Im going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond. You know what, let him answer, please.  All right. Let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the Middle East and so on. And that is, you both mentionedalluded to this, and that is Syria. The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon. We have, what, more than a hundred people that were killed there in a bomb. There were demonstrations there, eight people dead. Mr. President, its been more than a year since you sawyou told Asad he had to go. Since then, 30,000 Syrians have died. Weve had 300,000 refugees. The war goes on; hes still there. Should we reassess our policy and see if we can find a better way to influence events there? Or is that even possible? And its youyou go first, sir. Governor. All right. Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do? Like, for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria? Could we get a quick response, Mr. President? Because I want to ask about Egypt. May I ask you, during the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for President Mubarak to go. Some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that. Do you have any regrets about that? Governor Romney, I want to hear your response to that. But I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak? All right. Youre going to get a chance to respond to that because thats a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is, what is Americas role in the world? And that is the question: What do each of you see as our role in the world? And I believe, Governor Romney, its your turn to go first. Mr. President. Governor Romney, wrong and reckless policies? Let me get back to foreign policy. Can I just get back to Okay. Gentlemen. All right. Governor Let me justI want to try to shift it, because we have heard some of this in the other debates. Governor, you say you want a bigger military, you want a bigger Navy. You dont want to cut defense spending. What I want to ask youwere talking about financial problems in this countrywhere are you going to get the money? But can you do this without driving us deeper into debt? Can he do that, Mr. President? Let Well, thats what Im trying to find out about.  All right. About 30 seconds.  All right. A lot to cover. Id like to move to the next segment: Red lines: Israel and Iran. Would either of youand youll have 2 minutes, and, President Obama, you have the first go at this one. Would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States, which, of course, is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan? And if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran? Its certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that promise to our allies. Mr. President. So youre saying weve already made that declaration? Two minutes. Let me ask both of you, there areas you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States, as part of an international group, have agreed in principle to talks about Irans nuclear program. What is the dealif there are such talkswhat is the deal that you would accept? Mr. President. All right. Governor. What if the Prime Minister of Israel called you on the phone and said: Our bombers are on the way. Were going to bomb Iran? What do you say? So you say it just wouldnt happen. Okay, well, lets see what All right. All right. All right, lets go. And that leads usthis takes us right to the next segment, Governor, Americas longest war, Afghanistan and Pakistan Governor, you get to go first here. You cantokay, but you cant have the President just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond. Well, with respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program there. And well give you Well catch up. The United States is scheduled to turn over responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghan Government in 2014. At that point we will withdraw our combat troops, leave a smaller force of Americansif I understand our policyin Afghanistan for training purposes. It seems to me the key question here is what do you do if the deadline arrives and it is obvious the Afghans are unable to handle their security? Do we still leave? And I believe, Governor Romney, you go first. Mr. President. All right, let me go to Governor Romney, because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there. General Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan. We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obamasbin Laden. It still provides safe haven for terrorists. Yet we continue to give Pakistan billions of dollars. Is it time for us to divorce Pakistan? Let me ask you, Governorbecause we know President Obamas position on thiswhat is your position on the use of drones? Lets go to the next segment, because its a very important one. It is the rise of China and future challenges for America. I want to just begin this by asking both of youand, Mr. President, you go first this timewhat do you believe is the greatest future threat to the national security of this country? All right. Governor. Well, Governor, let me just ask you, if you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people aresay youre just going to start a trade war with China on day one. Is thatisnt there a risk that that could happen? Governor I think we all love teachers. [Laughter] Gentlemen, thank you so much for a very vigorous debate. We have come to the end. It is time for closing statements. I believe youre first, Mr. President. Governor. Gentlemen, thank you both so much. That brings an end to this years debates. And we want to thank Lynn University and its students for having us. As I always do at the end of these debates, I leave you with the words of my mom, who said, go vote. [Laughter] It makes you feel big and strong. Good night.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 16 2012,The President,Governor Romney,\"\"\" Thank you, Jeremy. I appreciate your question. And thank you for being here this evening. And to all of those from Nassau County here that have come, thank you for your time. Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this event. Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this debate. Your question is one thats being asked by college kids all over this country. I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated. This was in Philadelphia, and she said: Ive got my degree, I cant find a job. Ive got three part-time jobs; theyre just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment. I cant begin to pay back my student loans. So what we have to do is two things. We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college and also make sure that when they get out of college theres a job. When I was Governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree you had to pass an exam. If you graduated in the top quarter of your class, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams Scholarship: 4 years tuition free to the college of your choice in Massachusetts; its a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. Were also going to have our loan program so that people are able to afford school. But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school. And whats happened over the last 4 years has been very, very hard for Americas young people. I want you to be able to get a job. I know what it takes to get this economy going. With half of college kids graduating this year without a collegeexcuse mewithout a job and without a college-level job, thats just unacceptable. And likewise, you got more and more debt on your back. So more debt and less jobs. Im going to change that. I know what it takes to create good jobs again. I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve. And kids across this country are going to recognize were bringing back an economy. Its not going to be like the last 4 years. The middle class has been crushed over the last 4 years, and jobs have been too scarce. I know what it takes to bring them back, and Im going to do that and make sure when you graduatewhen do you graduate?  Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright. And the fact that youre making an investment in higher education is critical not just to you, but to the entire Nation. Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country, but not just jobs, good-paying jobs, ones that can support a family. And what I want to do is build on the 5 million jobs that weve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone. And there are a bunch of things that we can do to make sure your future is bright. Number one: I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again. When Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, I said, were going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry, and its come surging back. I want to do that in industries not just in Detroit, but all across the country. And that means we change our Tax Code so were giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here. It also means were helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two: Weve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world. And the fact that youre going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education. And weve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you. But I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future. Number three: Weve got to control our own energy. Not only oil and natural gas, which weve been investing in, but also weve got to make sure were building the energy sources of the future, not just thinking about next year, but 10 years from now, 20 years from now. Thats why weve invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy-efficient cars. Weve got to reduce our deficit, but weve got to do it in a balanced way, asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours. And lets take the money that weve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America: roads, bridges, schools. We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright, but Americas future is going to be bright as well.  Candy, what Governor Romney said just isnt true. He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open, and we would have lost a million jobs. And thatdont take my word for it. Take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney, but theyll tell you his prescription wasnt going to work. And Governor Romney says hes got a five-point plan. Governor Romney doesnt have a five-point plan; he has a one-point plan. And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules. Thats been his philosophy in the private sector. Thats been his philosophy as Governor. Thats been his philosophy as a Presidential candidate. You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less. You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money. Thats exactly the philosophy that weve seen in place for the last decade. Thats whats been squeezing middle class families. And we have fought back for 4 years to get out of that mess. The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.  The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy. So heres what Ive done since Ive been President. We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years. Natural gas production is the highest its been in decades. We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment. But what Ive also said is we cant just produce traditional sources of energy. Weve also got to look to the future. Thats why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars. That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, youre going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas. Thats why weve doubled clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years. Now, I want to build on that. And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling. We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas. Weve got potentially 600,000 jobs and a hundred years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas. And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But weve also got to continue to figure out how we have efficient energy, because ultimately, thats how were going to reduce demand and thats whats going to keep gas prices lower. Now, Governor Romney will say hes got an all-of-the-above plan. But basically, his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies. So hes got the oil and gas part, but he doesnt have the clean energy part. And if were only thinking about tomorrow or the next day, and not thinking about 10 years from now, were not going to control our own economic future. Because China, Germany, theyre making these investments. And Im not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries. I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States. Thats going to help Jeremy get a job. Its also going to make sure that youre not paying as much for gas.  Candy, theres no doubt that world demand has gone up. But our production is going up. And were using oil more efficiently. And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true. Weve opened up public lands. Were actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration, and mythe previous President was an oil man. And natural gas isnt just appearing magically; were encouraging it and working with the industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say hes a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, whenGovernor, when you were Governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, This plant kills, and took great pride in shutting it down. And now suddenly, youre a big champion of coal. So what Ive tried to do is be consistent. With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology to make sure that even as were producing more coal, were producing it cleaner and smarter. Same thing with oil. Same thing with natural gas. And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years. Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and most importantly, were also starting to build cars that are more efficient. And thats creating jobs. That means those cars can be exported because thats the demand around the world, and it also means that it will save money in your pocketbook. Thats the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and thats what were going to do in the next 4 years.  Sure it is.  Not true, Governor Romney.  Its not true.  Governor, we have actually produced more oil on  Governor  Governor Romney, heres what we did: There were a whole bunch of oil companies  No, you  You want me to answer a question. Im happy to answer the question.  Heres what happened: You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they werent using. So what we said was, you cant just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when its most profitable for you. These are public lands, so if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.  And so what we did was take away those leases, and we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.  And production is up.  No it isnt.  Governor what youre saying is just not true. Its just not true.  Ill give you your time. Go ahead.  Well, Governor, if youre if youre asking me a question, Im going to answer it.  Okay. Go ahead.  Well, think about what the Governor just said. He said, when I took office the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86. Why is that? Because the economy was on the verge of collapse. Because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney is now promoting. What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong and at the same time produce energy. And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking aboutweve built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire Earth once. So Im all for pipelines. Im all for oil production. What Im not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation. So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs, when youve got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican Senator in thatin Iowa is all for it, providing tax credits to help this work. And Governor Romney says, Im opposed, Id get rid of it. Thats not an energy strategy for the future. And we need to win that future.  And I intend to win it as President of the United States.  Candy, its okay, Im used to being interrupted.  We  Youre doing great.  My philosophy on taxes has been simple, and that is, I want to give middle class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle class some relief, because they have been hit hard, over the last decade, over the last 15, over the last 20 years. So 4 years ago, I stood on a stage just like this oneactually, it was a town halland I said, I would cut taxes for middle class families, and thats what Ive done, by $3,600. I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth, and weve cut them 18 times. And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle class families and for small businesses. But what Ive also said is if were serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, weve also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more. So what Ive said is your first $250,000 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase. Im ready to sign that bill right now. The only reason its not happening is because Governor Romneys allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage, because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent. But what Ive also said is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was President. We created 23 million new jobs. Thats part of what took us from deficits to surplus. It will be good for our economy, and it will be good for job creation. Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy. He was on 60 Minutes just 2 weeks ago and he was asked, is it fair for somebody like you making $20 million a year to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or bus driver, somebody making $50,000 a year. And he said, yes, I think thats fair. Not only that, he said, I think thats what grows the economy. Well, I fundamentally disagree with that. I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college. I think that grows the economy. I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country. That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory. And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary, he stood on stage and said, Im going to give tax cutshe didnt say tax rate cuts, he said tax cutsto everybody, including the top 1 percent, you should believe him, because thats been his history. And thats exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy thats thriving for everybody.  No, its not settled. Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board 20 percent, along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporate changes in the Tax Code, it costs about $5 trillion. Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military is not asking for them. Thats $7 trillion. He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Thats another trillion dollars. Thats $8 trillion. Now, what he says is hes going to make sure that this doesnt add to the deficit and hes going to cut middle class taxes. But when hes asked how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close, he cant tell you. The fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher, hes already taken that off the board. Capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate, so were not going to get money that way. We havent heard from the Governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that. Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor. If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend 7 or $8 trillion and then were going to pay for it, but we cant tell you until maybe after the election how were going to do it, you wouldnt have taken such a sketchy deal. And neither should you, the American people, because the math doesnt add up. And whats at stake here is one of two things. Either, Candy, this blows up the deficit, because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that hes talking about7, $8 trillionthats before we even get to the deficit we already have. Or alternatively, its got to be paid for not only by closing deductions for wealthy individualsthat will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax ratesyoure going to be paying for it. Youll lose some deductions. And you cant buy this sales pitch. Nobody whos looked at it thats serious actually believes it adds up.  Well, Catherine, this is a great question. And I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids. And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed. My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank. She never got a college education even though she was smart as a whip. And she worked her way up to become a vice president at a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling. She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didnt complain. Thats not what you did in that generation. And this is one of the reasons why one of the firstthe first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill, and this is named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldnt bring suit because she should have found out about it earlier, when she had no way of finding out about it. So we fixed that. And thats an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family. This is not just a womens issue. This is a family issue; this is a middle class issue. And thats why weve got to fight for it. It also means that weve got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education. Earlier, Governor Romney talked abouthe wants to make Pell grants and other education accessible for young people. Well, the truth of the matter is, is that thats exactly what weve done. Weve expanded Pell grants for millions of people, including millions of young women all across the country. We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, lets just cut out the middleman. Lets give the money directly to students. And as a consequence, weve seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and thats going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace. But weve got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing. And weve also got to make sure that in every walk of life, we do not tolerate discrimination. Thats been one of the hallmarks of my administration. Im going to continue to push on this issue for the next 4 years.  Catherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romneys campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, Ill get back to you. And thats not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy. Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace, for example, their health care. A major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. I think thats a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody whos insured, because this is not just a health issue, its an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that familys pocket. Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that, in fact, employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. Thats not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. Thats a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country, and it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work. When we talk about child care and the credits that were providing, that makes a difference in terms of whether they can go out there and earn a living for their family. These are not just womens issues. These are family issues. These are economic issues. And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same, fair deal as men are. And Ive got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybodys sons have. Thats a part of what Im fighting for as President of the United States.  I dont think so, Candy. I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.  All right.  Governor, thats not true.  Well, first of all, I think its important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started. But we have been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well. And weve seen 30 consecutive31 consecutive months of job growth, 5.2 million new jobs created. And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. Thats what took us from surplus to deficit. When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China and is currently investing in countriesin companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks. ThatsGovernor, youre the last person who is going to get tough on China. And what weve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but weve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field. Weve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration, and weve won every single one thats been decided. When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist, that it wouldnt be helpful to American workers. Well, in fact, we saved a thousand jobs. And thats the kind of tough trade actions that are required. But the last point I want to make is this: There are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush. George Bush didnt propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform; he didnt call for self-deportation. George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. So there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but theyre not on economic policy. In some ways, hes gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy. And I think thats a mistake. Thats not how were going to move our economy forward.  Well, weve gone through a tough 4 years, theres no doubt about it. But 4 years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families, and I did. I told you Id cut taxes for small businesses, and I have. I said that Id end the war in Iraq, and I did. I said wed refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaidas leadership like never before, and Usama bin Laden is dead. I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies cant jerk you around and if you dont have health insurance, that youd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have. I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. Weve created 5 million jobsgone from 800,000 jobs a month being lostand we are making progress. We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse. Now, does that mean youre not struggling? Absolutely not. A lot of us are. And thats why the plan that Ive put forward for manufacturing and education and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars to rebuild America and putting people back to work, making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not just the energy of today, but also the energy of the futureall those things will make a difference. So the point is the commitments Ive made Ive kept. And those that I havent been able to keep, its not for lack of trying, and were going to get it done in a second term. But you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well, and I suspect hell keep those too. When Members of the Republican Congress say, were going to sign a no-tax pledge so that we dont ask a dime from millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education and helping kids go to college, he said, me too. When they said, were going to cut Planned Parenthood funding, he said, me too. When they said, were going to repeal Obamacarethe first thing Im going to do, despite the fact that its the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working wellhe said, me too. That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises hes going to keep.  And the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life, make sure your kids can go to college, make sure that you are getting a good-paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security will be there for you.  This is for Governor Romney?  Good, I look forward to it. Was it Lorena? Lorraine. We are a nation of immigrants. I mean, were just a few miles away from Ellis Island. We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here: people who are willing to take risks; people who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have even bigger dreams than they have. But were also a nation of laws. So what Ive said is, we need to fix a broken immigration system. And Ive done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fixed the system. First thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler, and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law, to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country. And thats good for our economic growth. Theyll start new businesses. Theyll make things happen that create jobs here in the United States. Number two, we do have to deal with our border, so weve put more Border Patrol on than any time in history, and the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than its been in 40 years. What Ive also said is, if were going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gangbangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because theyre trying to figure out how to feed their families. And thats what weve done. And what Ive also said is, for young people who come here, brought here oftentimes by their parents, have gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag, think of this as their country, understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers, then we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship. And thats what Ive done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said that he wants to help those young people too. But during the Republican primary he said, I will veto the DREAM Act that would allow these young people to have access. His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, were going to encourage self-deportation: making life so miserable on folks that theyll leave. He called the Arizona law a model for the Nation. Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected, maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers. And you know what? If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like theyre not a citizen, I dont want to empower somebody like that. So we can fix this system in a comprehensive way. And when Governor Romney says the challenge is, well, Obama didnt try, thats not true. I sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term, and I said, lets fix this system, including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side. But its very hard for Republicans in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something Im interested in supporting.  Candy, hold on a second. At some point, well pick that up.  Governor Romney, Im used to being interrupted. I need to make sure  Candy  Candy, Ive got to say, I mean  You know, I dont look at my pension. Its not as big as yours, so it doesnt take as long. [Laughter]  I dont check it that often.  All right. Candy, were a little off topic here.  Come on. I thought we were talking about immigration.  I do want to make sure  I do want to make sure that we just understand something. Governor Romney says he wasnt referring to Arizona as a model for the Nation. His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it. Not E-Verify, the whole thing. Thats his policy. And its a bad policy. And it wont help us grow. Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand, there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise. And they provide us energy, and they provide us innovation. And they start companies like Intel and Google, and we want to encourage that. Now, weve got to make sure that we do it in a smart way, in a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better. But when we make this into a divisive political issue and when we dont have bipartisan supportI can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we cant  We cant We cantwe have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.  And its time for them to get serious on it.  This used to be a bipartisan issue.  Im here. [Laughter]  Okay. Hi, Kara.  Im sorry, whats your name?  Great to see you here.  Well, let me, first of all, talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation. And these arent just representatives of the United States, theyre my representatives. I send them there, oftentimes into harms way. I know these folks, and I know their families. So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am. So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team, and I gave them three instructions. Number one, beef up our security and procedures not just in Libya, but in every Embassy and consulate in the region. Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure that folks are held accountable and it doesnt happen again. And number three, we are going to find out who did this, and we are going to hunt them down, because one of the things that Ive said throughout my Presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them. Now, Governor Romney had a very different response. While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points. And thats not how a Commander in Chief operates. You dont turn national security into a political issue, certainly not right when its happening. And peoplenot everybody agrees with some of the decisions Ive made, but when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say. I said Id end the war in Libyain Iraq, and I did. I said that wed go after Al Qaida and bin Laden, we have. I said wed transition out of Afghanistan and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security. Thats what Im doing. And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountableand I am ultimately responsible for whats taking place there, because these are my folks, and Im the one who has to greet those coffins when they come homeyou know that I mean what I say.  Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job, but she works for me. Im the President, and Im always responsible. And thats why nobody is more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do. The day after the attack, Governor, I stood in the Rose Garden, and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror, and I also said that were going to hunt down those who committed this crime. And then, a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families. And the suggestion that anybody in my teamwhether the Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador, anybody on my teamwould play politics or mislead when weve lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive. Thats not what we do. Thats not what I do as President. Thats not what I do as Commander in Chief.  Thats what I said.  Please proceed.  Please proceed, Governor.  Get the transcript.  Can you say that a little louder, Candy?  Candy?  Candy, Im happy to have a longer conversation about foreign policy.  Okay, Im happy to do that too.  I just want to make sure that all these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.  Were a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment. Weve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves. But there have been too many instances during the course of my Presidency where Ive had to comfort families who have lost somebody, most recently, out in Aurora. Just a couple of weeks agoactually probably about a monthI saw a mother who I had met at the bedside of her son who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head. And we spent some time, and we said a prayer. And remarkably, about 2 months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new. But there were a lot of families who didnt have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didnt survive. So my belief is that, A, we have to enforce the laws weve already got, make sure that were keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. Weve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but weve got more to do when it comes to enforcement. But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters dont belong on our streets. And so what Im trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced, but part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because, frankly, in my hometown of Chicago, theres an awful lot of violence, and theyre not using AK-47s, theyre using cheap handguns. And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity? That our schools are working? That if theres violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control. And so what I want is a comprehensive strategy. Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.  Candy.  Candy.  Candy.  First of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it. And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. So thats on the record. But I think that one area we agree on is the importance of parents and the importance of schools, because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then theyre less likely to engage in these kind of violent acts. Were not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbedand weve got to make sure that they dont get weaponsbut we can make a difference in terms of ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed. And, Candy, we havent had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms weve put in place, working with 46 Governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed; were starting to see gains in math and science. When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school, but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now. And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers, and so were matching them up, giving them access to higher education. As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they werent able to get before. Now But  Just one second  because this is important. This is part of the choice in this election. When Governor Romney was asked whether teachershiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesnt grow our economy. When he was asked, iswas class size  I understand.  But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people  and reduce our violence.  We need to create jobs here. And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate. Its too high. But theres a difference in terms of how we would do it. I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore. All those changes in our Tax Code would make a difference. Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks. One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you dont have to pay U.S. taxes. But of course, if youre a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, youve got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney is talking about. And its estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs; the problem is theyll be in China or India or Germany. Thats not the way were going to create jobs here. The way were going to create jobs here is not just to change our Tax Code, but also to double our exports. And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was President. Thats creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country. Thats why weve kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal. Now, Governor Romney talked about China. As I already indicated, in the private sector, Governor Romneys company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing. Thats not my phrase. Thats what reporters called it. And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since Ive been President because we have pushed them hard. And weve put unprecedented trade pressure on China. Thats why exports have significantly increased under my Presidency. Thats going to help to create jobs here.  How much time you got, Candy?  All right, Im  Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back because theyre low-wage, low-skill jobs. I want high-wage, high-skill jobs. Thats why we have to emphasize manufacturing. Thats why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing. Thats why weve got to make sure that weve got the best science and research in the world. And when we talk about deficits, if were adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who dont need them and were cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race. If were not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country, then companies wont come here. Those investments are whats going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now.  Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last 4 years, has been devoted to this notion that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer. Thats not what I believe. I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known. I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded. But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because thats how our economy is grown. Thats how we built the worlds greatest middle class. And that is part of whats at stake in this election. Theres a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward. I believe Governor Romney is a good man, loves his family, cares about his faith. But I also believe that when he said, behind closed doors, that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims, who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about: folks on Social Security who have worked all their lives; veterans who have sacrificed for this country; students who are out there trying to, hopefully, advance their own dreams, but also this countrys dreams; soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now; people who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but dont make enough income. And I want to fight for them. Thats what Ive been doing for the last 4 years, because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds. And when my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a GI Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasnt a handout, that was something that advanced the entire country. And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities. Thats why Im asking for your vote, and thats why Im asking for another 4 years. \"\"\",\"\"\" 2014. When you come out in 2014, I presume Im going to be President; Im going to make sure you get a job. Thanks, Jeremy.  Yes, you bet.  Well, what youre seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job and a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time. The Presidents policies have been exercised over the last 4 years, and they havent put Americans back to work. We have fewer people working today than we had when the President took office. If thethe unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office; its 7.8 percent now. But if you calculated that unemployment rate taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent. We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work. Thats why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in 4 years and rising take-home pay. Its going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school. Its going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now. And one thing that the President said, which I want to make sure that we understand: He said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt. And thats right. My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macys and Continental Airlines and come out stronger. And I know he keeps saying, you wanted to take Detroit bankrupt. Well, the President took Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. And I think its important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet so they could start hiring more people. That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.  That Detroit answer that Detroit answer and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.  Well, lets look at the Presidents policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because weve had 4 years of policies being played out. And the Presidents right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on Federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on Federal land, and gas production is down 9 percent. Why? Because the President cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on Federal lands and in Federal waters. So where did the increase come from? Well, a lot of it came from the Bakken range in North Dakota. What was his participation there? The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have. And what was the cause? Twenty or 25 birds were killed, and they brought out a Migratory Bird Act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables. I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix. But what we dont need is to have the President keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal, and gas. This has not been Mr. Oil or Mr. Gas or Mr. Coal. Talk to the people that are working in those industries. I was in coal country. People grab my arms and say, please save my job. The head of the EPA said you cant build a coal plant. Hell virtuallyits virtually impossible given our regulations. When the President ran for office, he said, if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but youll go bankrupt. Thats not the right course for America. Lets take advantage of the energy resources we have as well as the energy sources for the future. And if we do that, if we do what Im planning on doing, which is getting us energy independentNorth America energy independence within 8 yearsyoure going to see manufacturing jobs come back, because our energy is low cost. Theyre already beginning to come back, because of our abundant energy. Ill get America and North America energy independent. Ill do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses. Were going to bring that pipeline in from Canada. How in the world the President said no to that pipeline I will never know. This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and thats what Im going to do.  But thats not what youve done in the last 4 years. Thats the problem.  In the last 4 years, you cut permits and licenses on Federal land and Federal waters in half.  So how much did you cut it by?  By how much did you cut them by then?  No, no, how much did you cut licenses and permits  on Federal land and Federal waters?  No, I had a question  and the question was how much did you cut them by? How much did you cut them by?  All right, and it is?  Okay, now, thats  And production on privateon Government lands  is down.  Production on Government land of oil is down 14 percent and production of gas is down 9 percent.  Its absolutely true. Look, theres no question but that the people recognize that we have not produced more oil and gas on Federal lands and in Federal waters. And coal? Coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up. I was just at a coal facility where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy. I dont think anyone really believes that youre a person whos going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal. Youll get your chance in a moment. Im still speaking.  And the answer is, I dont believe people think thats the case because I  That wasnt a question.  That was a statement. I dont think the American people believe that. I will fight for oil, coal, and natural gas. And the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that youre paying at the pump. If youre paying less than you paid a year or 2 ago, why, then, the strategy is working. But youre paying more. When the President took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about a buck-eighty-six a gallon. Now its 4 bucks a gallon. The price of electricity is up. If the Presidents energy policies are working, youre going to see the cost of energy come down. I will fight to create more energy in this country to get America energy secure, and part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia, where the people want it.  Those things will get us the energy we need.  No, he got the first  He actually got the first question, so I get the last questionlast answer on that one. Actually  Candy, I dont have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa. And theyre not phantom jobs, theyre real jobs.  I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country. I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas. Im going to make sure  that taking advantage of our energy resources will bring back manufacturing to America. Were going to get through a very aggressive energy policy3 million more jobs in this country. Its critical to our future.  Hi, Mary.  Thank you very much. And let me tell you, youre absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down. I want to simplify the Tax Code, and I want to get middle income taxpayers to have lower taxes. And the reason I want middle income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle income taxpayers have been buried over the past 4 years. Youve seen, as middle income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000. Health insurance premiums up $2,500. Food prices up. Utility prices up. The middle income families in America have been crushed over the last 4 years, so I want to get some relief to middle income families. Thats part one. Now, how about deductions? Because Im going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but Im going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than theyre paying now. The top 5 percent of the taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the Nation collects. So that will stay the same. Middle income people are going to get a tax break. And so in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be to say everybody getsIll pick a number$25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use. Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part offill in that bucket, if you will, of deductions. But your rate comes down, and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is, every middle income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends, or capital gains; no tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier. If youre getting interest from a bank, if youre getting a statement from a mutual fund, or any other kind of investments you have, you dont have to worry about filing taxes on that because there will be no taxes for anybody making $200,000 a year and less on your interest, dividends, and capital gains. Why am I lowering taxes on the middle class? Because under the last 4 years, theyve been buried, and I want to help people in the middle class. And I will notI will not under any circumstances reduce the share thats being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle class. The Presidents spending, the Presidents borrowing will cause this Nation to have to raise taxes on the American people, not just at the high end. A recent study has shown that people in the middle class will see $4,000 a year higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration. I will not let that happen. Ill get us on track to a balanced budget, and Im going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families. And whats that going to do? Its going to help those families, and its going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.  Thank you.  Youre absolutely right. You heard what I said about my tax plan. The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today. Im not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people. I am looking to cut taxes for middle income people. And why do I want to bring rates down and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end? Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people. And for me, this is about jobs. I want to get Americas economy going again. Fifty-four percent of Americas workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people. For me, I look at whats happened in the last 4 years and say this has been a disappointment. We can do better than this. We dont have to settle forhow many months?43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now. There are 3 million more women living in poverty today than when the President took office. We dont have to live like this. We can get this economy going again. My five-point plan does it. Energy independence for North America in 5 years; opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America; cracking down on China when they cheat; getting us to a balanced budget; fixing our training programs for our workers; and, finally, championing small business. I want to help small businesses grow and thrive. I know how to make that happen. I spent my life in the private sector. I know why jobs come and why they go. And theyre going now because of the policies of this administration.  Thank you, an important topic and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as Governor of my State, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet, and all the applicants seemed to be men. And I went to my staff, and I said, how come all the people for these jobs are all men? And they said, well, these are the people that have the qualifications. And I said, well, gosh, cant we find some women that are also qualified? And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of womens groups and said, can you help us find folks? And they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 States and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other State in America. Now, one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort, but number two, because I recognize that if youre going to have women in the workforce, that sometimes they need to be more flexible. My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school. She said, I cant be here until 7 or 8 oclock at night; I need to be able to get home at 5 oclock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school. So we said, fine, lets have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. Were going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy Im going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers, theyre going to be anxious to hire women. In the last 4 years, women have lost 580,000 jobs. Thats the net of whats happened in the last 4 years. Were still down 580,000 jobs. I mentioned 3 million women more now in poverty than 4 years ago. What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women the opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford. This is what Ive done. Its what I look forward to doing. And I know what it takes to make an economy work. And I know what a working economy looks like. And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy. An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy. An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that cant find a job, or a college-level job, thats not what we have to have. Im going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.  Great. Thank you. And I appreciate that question. I just want to make sure thatI think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that I dont believe  The time  Id just note that I dont believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I dont believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And the Presidents statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.  Let me come back and answer your question. President Bush and I are different people, and these are different times. And thats why my five-point plan is so different than what he would have done. I mean, for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology, actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else. That wasnt true in his time. Thats why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America, become energy secure. Number two, trade: Ill crack down on China. President Bush didnt. Im also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America. Its been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time. I want to add more free trade agreements so well have more trade. Number three, Im going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didnt. President Obama was right: He said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years. He was right. But then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his 4 years, and his forecast for the next 4 years is more deficits almost that large. So thats the next area Im different than President Bush. And then lets take the last one, championing small business. Our party has been focused on big business too long. I came through small business. I understand how hard it is to start a small business. Thats why everything Ill do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs. I want to keep their taxes down, on small business. I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it. And the thing I find most troubling about Obamacarewell, its a long listbut one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people. My priority is jobs. I know how to make that happen. And President Bush had a very different path for a very different time. My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.  I think you know better. I think you know that these last 4 years havent been so good as the President just described and that you dont feel like youre confident that the next 4 years are going to be much better either. I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what youre going to get. Youre going to get a repeat of the last 4 years. We just cant afford 4 more years like the last 4 years. He said that by now wed have unemployment at 5.4 percent. The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work. I wasnt the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the Presidents plan; didnt get there. He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out theyre on the road to bankruptcy. He would reform them. Hed get that done. He hasnt even made a proposal on either one. He said in his first year hed put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges; didnt even file it. This is a President who has not been able to do what he said hed do. He said that hed cut in half the deficit. He hasnt done that either; in fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. Its gone up by 2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passedor implemented, its already been passedif its implemented fully, it will be another 2,500 on top. The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a President who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again. He keeps saying, look, Ive created 5 million jobs. Thats after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans. There are more people in poverty: one out of six people in poverty. How about food stamps? When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps. Today, 47 million people are on food stamps. How about the growth of the economy? Its growing more slowly this year than last year and more slowly last year than the year before. The President wants to do well, I understand. But the policies hes put in place, from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have. You might say, well, you got an example of when it worked better? Yes. In the Reagan recession, where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that periodthe end of that recession and the equivalent period of time to today, Ronald Reagans recovery created twice as many jobs as this Presidents recovery. Five million jobs doesnt even keep up with our population growth. And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce. The President has tried, but his policies havent worked. Hes great as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. Thats wonderful, except we have a record to look at. And that record shows, he just hasnt been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need. Median incomes down $4,300 a family and 23 million Americans out of work, thats what this election is about. Its about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.  Is it Lorena?  Lorraine.  Good, thanks.  Thank you, Lorraine. Did I get that right? Good. Thank you for question. And let me step back and tell you what Id like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question. First of all, this is a nation of immigrants. We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants. My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Anns dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American. We welcome legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better. I want it to be streamlined. I want it to be clearer. I dont think you have toshouldnt have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally. I also think that we should give visas to peoplegreen cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need. People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math, get a green card stapled to their diploma; come to the U.S. of A. We should make sure that our legal system works. Number two, were going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally. Those whove come here illegally take their place. So I will not grant amnesty to those whove come here illegally. What I will do is Ill put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so. I wont put in place magnets for people coming here illegally. So for instance, I would not give drivers licenses to those that have come here illegally, as the President would. The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids I think should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States. And military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident. Now, when the President ran for office, he said that hed put in place in his first year a piece of legislationhed file a bill in his first yearthat would reform our immigration systemprotect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration. He didnt do it. He had a Democrat House and Democrat Senate, supermajority in both Houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come here legally and for those that are here illegally today? Thats a question I think the President will have a chance to answer to answer right now.  Lets  No, let me go back and speak to the points that the President made, and lets get them correct. I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the Nation in that aspect. I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the Nation. Thats number one. Number two, I asked the President a question, I think, Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked. He was asked this on Univision the other day. Why, when you said youd file legislation in your first year, didnt you do it? And he didnt answer. He doesnt answer that question. He said the standard bearer wasnt for it. Im glad you thought I was a standard bearer 4 years ago, but I wasnt. Four years ago, you said in your first year, you would file legislation. In his first year, I was just gettinglicking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right. I was not the standard bearer. My view is that this President should have honored his promise to do as he said. Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says, let people make their own choice. What I was saying is were not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the Nation. Instead, let people make their own choice. And if they find that they cant get the benefits here that they want and they cant find the job they want, then theyll make a decision to go a place where they have better opportunities. But Im not in favor of rounding up people and taking them out of this country. I am in favor, as the President has saidand I agree with himwhich is that if people have committed crimes, weve got to get them out of this country. Let me mention something else the President said. It was a moment ago, and I didnt get a chance towhen he was describing Chinese investments and so forth  Mr. President, Im still speaking.  Mr. President, why dont you let me finish  Im going to continue. Im going to continue. The President made  Yes, just going to make a point. Any investments I have over the last 8 years have been managed by a blind trust. And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in Chinese companies. Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?  Have you looked at your pension?  Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?  Let me give you some advice.  Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust.  Ill get it done.  Ill get it done the first year  Thank you, Kerry, for your question. Its an important one, and I think the President just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk, and he takes responsibility for thatfor the failure in providing those security resources. And those terrible things may well happen from time to time. I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones. And today theres a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy. We think of their families and care for them deeply. There were other issues associated with this tragedy. There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration or actually whether it was a terrorist attack. And there was no demonstration involved. It was a terrorist attack. And it took a long time for that to be told to the American people. Whether there was some misleading or, instead, whether we just didnt know what happened, I think you have to ask yourself, why didnt we know 5 days later when the Ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration? How could we have not known? But I find more troubling than this that on the day following the assassination of the United States Ambassadorthe first time thats happened since 1979when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didnt know what happened, that the President, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, another political event. I think these actions taken by a President and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that youd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses. Weve read their accounts now about what happened. It was very clear, this was not a demonstration, this was an attack by terrorists. And this calls into question the Presidents whole policy in the Middle East. Look whats happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya. Consider the distance between ourselves and Israel. The President said that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel. We have Iran 4 years closer to a nuclear bomb. Syria: Syria is not just the tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategically significant player for America. The Presidents policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour, and pursue a strategy of leading from behind. And this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.  Yes, I certainly do. I certainly do. I think its interesting the President just said something, which is that on the day after the attack, he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.  You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror? It was not a spontaneous demonstration?  Is that what youre saying?  I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the President 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.  The administration indicated that this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.  It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group. And to suggestam I incorrect in that regard? On Sunday, theyour Secretary excuse me, the Ambassador to the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how this was a spontaneous reaction.  Yes, Im not in favor of new pieces of legislation on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal. We, of course, dont want to have automatic weapons, and thats already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons. What I believe is, we have to do, as the President mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have and to change the culture of violence we have. And you ask, how are we going to do that? And there are a number of things. He mentioned good schools. I totally agree. We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the Nation in my State, and I believe if we do a better job in education, well give people the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that. But let me mention another thing, and that is parents. We need moms and dads helping raise kids. Wherever possible, the benefit of having two parents in the homeand thats not always possible, a lot of great single moms, single dadsbut gosh, to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, thats a great idea, because if theres a two-parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically. The opportunities that the child will be able to achieve increase dramatically. So we can make changes in the way our culture works to help bring people away from violence and give them opportunity and bring them in the American system. The greatest failure weve had with regards to gun violence in some respects is what is known as Fast and Furious, which was a program under this administration. And how it worked exactly, I think we dont know precisely, but where thousands of automatic and AK-47-type weapons were given to people that ultimately gave them to drug lords; they used those weapons against their own citizens and killed Americans with them. And this was a program of the Government. For what purpose it was put in place, I cant imagine. But its one of the great tragedies related to violence in our society which has occurred during this administration, which I think the American people would like to understand fully. Its been investigated to a degree, but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all the information from coming out. Id like to understand, who it was that did this, what the idea was behind it, why it led to the violence. Thousands of guns going to Mexico drug lords  Well, Candy, actually, in my State, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation. And its referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted. There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that hadnt previously been available and so forth. So it was a mutually agreed-upon piece of legislation. Thats what we need more of, Candy. What we have right now in Washington is a place thats gridlocked.  We havent had the leadership in Washington to work at a bipartisan basis. I was able to do that in my State and bring these two together.  Boy, great question, an important question, because youre absolutely right. The place where weve seen manufacturing go has been China. China is now the largest manufacturer in the world, used to be the United States of America. A lot of good people have lost jobs. A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last 4 years; thats total over the last 4 years. One of the reasons for that is that people think its more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here. We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time. What I will do as President is make sure its more attractive to come to America again. This is the way were going to create jobs in this country. Its not by trickle-down government, saying were going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations. Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere. I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America. Now, were going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules, and China hasnt. One of the reasonsor one of the ways they dont play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency. Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low, and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace. We lose sales, and manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products cant compete. China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the President has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as President to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers. So were going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules. But let me not just stop there. Dont forget: Whats key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punishand Im going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they follow the law and play by the rulesbut its also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds. Thats why I want to bring down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canadas tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if youre starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if were going to create more jobs here. Regulations have quadrupled; the rate of regulations quadrupled under this President. Ive talked to small businesses across the country. They say, we feel like were under attack from our own Government. I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it. And theres no question, but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people. My priority is making sure that we get more people hired. If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then youre going to see rising incomes again. The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high. I know what it takes to get this to happen. And my plan will do that. And one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules. Thank you.  The answer is very straightforward: We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level. China has been cheating over the years: one, by holding down the value of their currency; number two, by stealing our intellectual property, our designs, our patents, our technology. Theres even an Apple store in China thats a counterfeit Apple store selling counterfeit goods. They hack into our computers. We will have to have people play on a fair basis. Thats number one. Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand a business. Thats what brings jobs in. The Presidents characterization of my tax plan is is completely is completely false. Let me tell you.  Government does not create jobs.  Government does not create jobs.  Barry? Oh, theres Barry. Hi, Barry.  Thank you, and thats an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it. In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things theyd like to do. In the course of that, I think the Presidents campaign has tried to characterize me as someone whos very different than who I am. I care about 100 percent of the American people. I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. I care about our kids. I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again. I spent my life in the private sector, not in government. Im a guy who wants to help, with the experience I have, the American people. My passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God and I believe were all children of the same God. I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another. I served as a missionary for my church. I served as a pastor in my congregation for about 10 years. Ive sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times. I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track. And as Governor of my State, I was able to get 100 percent of my people insured, all my kids, about 98 percent of the adults; was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the Nation so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future. I understand that I can get this country on track again. We dont have to settle for what were going through. We dont have to settle for gasoline at $4. We dont have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level. We dont have to settle for 47 million people on food stamps. We dont have to settle for 50 percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work. We dont have to settle for 23 million people struggling to find a good job. If I become President, Ill get America working again. I will get us on track to a balanced budget. The President hasnt. I will. Ill make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming generations. The President said he would. He didnt.  Ill get our incomes up. And by the way, Ive done these things. I served as Governor and showed I could get them done. \"\"\",\"\"\"We are here for the second Presidential Debate, a town hall sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Gallup organization chose 82 uncommitted voters from the New York area. Their questions will drive the night. My goal is to give the conversation direction and to ensure questions get answered. The questions are known to me and my team only. Neither the commission, nor the candidates have seen them. I hope to get to as many questions as possible, and because I am the optimistic sort, Im sure the candidates will oblige by keeping their answers concise and on point. Each candidate has as much as 2 minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a 2-minute follow-up. The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite and attentive; no cheering, no booing, or outbursts of any sort. We will set aside that agreement just this once to welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney. Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us here tonight. We have a lot of folks who have been waiting all day to talk to you, so I want to get right to it. Governor Romney, as you know, you won the coin toss, so the first question will go to you. And I want to turn to a first-time voter, Jeremy Epstein, who has a question for you.  Mr. President.  Let me ask you for a more immediate answer, beginning with Mr. Romney. Just quickly, what can you do? Were looking at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed have been unemployed for 6 months or more. They dont have the 2 years that Jeremy has. What about those long-term unemployed who need a job right now?  Let me give the President a chance. Go ahead.  Mr. President, the next question is going to be for you here. And Mr. RomneyGovernor Romney, therell be plenty of chances here to go on, but I want to we have all these folksI will let you absolutely  Okay. Wellyou certainly will have lots of time here coming up, because I want to move you on to something thats sort of connected to cars here and go overand we want to get a question from Phillip Tricolla.  Governor, on the subject of gas prices?  Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is, are we looking at the new normal? I can tell you that tomorrow morning a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon. Is it within the purview of the Government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal?  Let me give  Mr. President, could you addressbecause we did finally get to gas prices herecould you address what the Governor said, which is if your energy policy was working, the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon here. Is that true?  Mr. President  I got to move you along.   And the next question is for you.  Actually, in the follow-up it doesnt quite work like that. [Laughter]  But Im going to give you a chance here. I promise you, Im going to. And the next question is for you, so if you want to continue on. But I dont want to leave all these guys sitting here, so  Okay.  And youreokay. Thank you, Governor.  Were going to move you along to taxes.  All right, were going to move you both along to taxes over here and all these folks that have been waiting. Governor, this question is for you. It comes from Mary PolonoPolano, sorry.  Thanks, Governor.  Governor Romney, Im sure youve got a reply there. [Laughter]  Governor, let me ask the President something about what you just said. The Governor says that he is not going to allow the top 5 percentI believe is what he saidto have a tax cut, that it will all even out, that what he wants to do is give that tax cut to the middle class. Settled?  Governor Romney, pay equity for women. Governor  Mr. President, why dont you get in on this quickly, please? . Mr. President  I want to move us along here to Susan Katz who has a question. And, Governor, its for you.  The timekeepers are all working.  And let me tell you that the last part, its for the two of you to talk to one another, and it isnt quite as ordered as you think. But go ahead and use this 2 minutes any way youd like to, the question is on the floor.  Thanks, Governor. Mr. President.  I want to move you both along to the next question because its in the same wheelhouse so you will be able to respond. But the President does get this question. I want to call on Michael Jones.  Mr. President, let me let  Mr. President, thank you. Governor.  Governor, I want to move you along. Dont go away, and well have plenty of time to respond. We are quite aware of the clock for both of you. But I want to bring in a different subject here. Mr. President, Ill be right back with you. Lorraine Osario has a question for you about a topic we have not heard.  Yes, this is for Governor Romney, and well be right with you, Mr. President. Thanks.  Let me get the Governor in here, Mr. President. Lets speak to, if you could, Governor the idea of self-deportation.  Im sorry  Go ahead and finish, Governor Romney. Governor Romney, if you could make it short. See all these people, theyve been waiting for you. Could you make it short and then  We are sort of way off topic here, Governor Romney.  We are completely off immigration.  And wevequickly, Mr. President  If I could have you sit down, Governor Romney. Thank you.  Mr. President, let me move you on here, please. Mr. President  Dont go away, though.  Right. Dont go away, because I want you to talk to Kerry Ladka, who has awants to switch a topic for us.  Mr. President, Ive got to move us along. Governor.  Because were closing in, I want to still get a lot of people in. I want to ask you something, Mr. President, and then have the Governor just quickly. Your Secretary of State, as Im sure you know, has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Does the buck stop with your Secretary of State, as far as what went on here?  Governor, if you want to reply just quickly to this please.  He did, in fact, sir. So let mecall it an act of terror in the Rose Garden. He used the word  He did call it an act of terror. It did, as well, take 2 weeks or so for the whole idea of there being a riot out there about this tape to come out. You are correct about that.  They did.  Mr. President, let meI know youabsolutely. But I want to move you on.  And also, people can go to the transcripts and figure out what was said and when.  Because what I want to do, Mr. President, stand there for a second, because I want to introduce you to Nina Gonzalez, who brought up a question that we hear a lot both over the Internet and from this crowd.  Governor Romney, the question is about assault weapons, AK-47s.  Governor, Governor, if I could, the question was about these assault weapons that once were banned and are no longer banned. I know that you signed an assault weapons ban when you were in Massachusetts. Obviously, with this question, you no longer do support that. Why is that? Given the kind of violence that we see, sometimes with these mass killings, why is that, that youve changed your mind?  So if I couldif you could get people to agree to it, youd be for it?  Go ahead, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I have to move you along here. You said you wanted to hear this question, so we need to do it here. One  The question, of course, Mr. President, was guns here, so I need to move us along. The question was guns, so let me bring in another  I understand. Okay. Thank you so much. I want to ask Carol Goldberg to stand up because she gets to a question that both these men have been passionate about. Its for Governor Romney.  Mr. President, 2 minutes here because we are then going to go to our last question.  Mr. President, we have a really short time for a quick discussion here. iPad, the Macs, the iPhones, they are all manufactured in China. One of the major reasons is labor is so much cheaper here. How do you convince a great American company to bring that manufacturing back here?  Let me go to the  Let me go to the President here because we really are because we really are running out of time. And the question is, can we ever getwe cant get wages like that. It cant be sustained here.  Thanks, Mr. President.  Governor Romney.  Governor Romney, I want to introduce you to Barry Green because hes going to have the last question to you first.  Governor.  Mr. President, last 2 minutes belong to you.  President Obama, Governor Romney, thank you for being here tonight. On that note, we have come to an end of this town hall debate. Our thanks to the participants for their time and to the people of Hofstra University for their hospitality. The next and final debate takes place Monday night at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida. Dont forget to watch. Election Day is 3 weeks from today. Dont forget to vote. Goodnight.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 3 2012,The President,Governor Romney,\"\"\" Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney, and the University of Denver for your hospitality. Four years ago, we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, weve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, weve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back, and housing has begun to rise. But we all know that weve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where weve been, but where were going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations that well be better off. Ive got a different view. I think weve got to invest in education and training. I think its important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America; that we change our Tax Code to make sure that were helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States; that we take some of the money that were saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America; and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the votersto youwhich path we should take. Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess? Or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And Im looking forward to having that debate.  Thank you, Jim. Its an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the President. Im pleased to be at the University of Denver, I appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates. This is obviously a very tender topic. Ive had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, Ive been out of work since May, can you help me? Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver, and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, Ann, my husband has had four jobs in 3 years, part-time jobs. Hes lost his most recent job, and weve now just lost our home. Can you help us? And the answer is, yes, we can help, but its going to take a different path, not the one weve been on, not the one the President describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich; thats not what Im going to do. My plan has five basic parts: One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America; crack down on China if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world; we are far away from that now. Number four, get us to a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. Its small business that creates the jobs in America. And over the last 4 years, small-businesspeople have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business, because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. I know what it takes to get small business growing again, to hire people. Now, Im concerned that the path that were on has just been unsuccessful. The President has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran 4 years ago: that a bigger Government spending more, taxing more, regulating moreif you will, trickle-down Governmentwould work. Thats not the right answer for America. Ill restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.  Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, weve got to improve our education system. And weve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest-to-deal-with schools. Weve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 States around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another hundred thousand new math and science teachers and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our Tax Code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturingtaking it down to 25 percentbut I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that weve got to boost American energy production. And oil and natural gas production are higher than theyve been in years. But I also believe that weve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments. So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit. And one of the things Im sure well be discussing tonight is how do we deal with our Tax Code and how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also how do we have enough revenue to make those investments. And this is where theres a difference, because Governor Romneys central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of the extension of the Bush tax cutsthats another trillion dollarsand $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasnt asked for. Thats $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs onto middle class Americans, I think, is one of the central questions of this campaign.  Well, I thinklets talk about taxes because I think its instructive. Now, 4 years ago when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle class families, and thats exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle class families by about $3,600. And the reason is because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who is going off to college, which means theyre spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romneys proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that hes been asked over a hundred times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasnt been able to identify them. But Im going to make an important point here, Jim. When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals canare currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you dont come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending. And thats why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romneys pledge of not reducing the deficitor not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle class families; the average middle class family with children would pay about $2,000 more. Now, thats not my analysis. Thats the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And that kind of top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making 3 million bucks is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle class families are burdened further, thats not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.  Well, for 18 months, hes been running on this tax plan. And now, 5 weeks before the election, hes saying that his big, bold idea is never mind. And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. Its math. Its arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small business 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax ratesthe tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was President, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because, by doing that, we can not only reduce the deficit, we can not only encourage job growth through small businesses, but were also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy. And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, theyre the job creators, theyd be burdened. But under Governor Romneys definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. And I know Donald Trump doesnt like to think of himself as small anything, but thats how you define small businesses if youre getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and researchall the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.  Thats okay.  Jim, Iyou may want to move on to another topic, but I would just say this to the American people: If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for$7 trillionjust to give you a sense, over 10 years, thats more than our entire defense budgetand you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romneys plan may work for you. But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us thats not a recipe for job growth. Look, weve tried this; weve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney is talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003. And we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years. We ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Bill Clinton tried the approach that Im talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So in some ways weve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans. And I believe that the economy works best when middle class families are getting tax breaks so that theyve got some money in their pockets and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure were not blowing up the deficit. . He can have them, he can have them. Go ahead. [Laughter]. . Go ahead. [Laughter] . All right. . Okay.  I like it.  When I walked into the Oval Office I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me, and we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card, two tax cuts that were not paid for, and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for, and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what weve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didnt slip into a great depression, but what weve also said is, lets make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 Government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered, but werent working very well, 18 Government programs for education that were well intentioned, but werent helping kids learn. We went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars: $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. Thats the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that weve got to do more, and so I put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. Its on a web site; you can look at all the numbers: what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut we ask for a dollar of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson Commission. Well, thats how the Commissionbipartisan Commission that talked about how we should move forward, suggested we have to do itin a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let me just finish this point because youre looking for contrast. When Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination, and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that . Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the States, but effectively, this means a 30-percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities. And that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.  Sorry.  Thats what weve done, made some adjustments to it, and were putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan of balanced . Right.  Well, weve had this discussion before  Right. There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. Hes ruled out revenue.  If were serious, weve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Lets talk about corporate taxes. Now, Ive identified areas where we can right away make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they dont get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money when theyre making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldnt we want to eliminate that? Why wouldnt we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue-neutral way, close loopholes, deductionshe hasnt identified which ones they arebut that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but Ive actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesnt make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me, shes got 42 kids in her class. The first 2 weeks, shes got some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. Theyre using textbooks that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. Thats not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, were going to have to make some decisions. And if were asking for no revenue, then that means that weve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that youre talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to States, were talking about potentially a 30-percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is papernumbers on a sheet of paper. But if were talking about a family whos got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, thats a big problem. And Governors are creative, theres no doubt about it. But theyre not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help. . Go ahead.  Its time to end it.  I suspect that on Social Security weve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. Its going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and SpeakerDemocratic Speaker Tip ONeill. But it isthe basic structure is sound. But I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare and then talk about Medicare because thats the big driver of our deficits right now. My grandmother, some of you know, helped to raise me, my grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died 3 days before I was elected President. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up. Only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And thats the perspective I bring when I think about whats called entitlements. The name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks whove worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this. So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term. And in Medicare, what we did was we said we are going to have to bring down the costs if were going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, lets look where some of the money is going: $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies, by making sure that we werent overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through thethroughout the system. So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you dont need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.  First of all, I think its important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. Its called premium support, but its understood to be a voucher program. His running mate  I dont. And let me explain why.  I understand.  So if youre 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldnt necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year. Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is, hell maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But theres still a problem, because what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare, and every health care economist who looks at it says, over time, what will happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse. And then what youve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care. So I dont think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not myonly my opinion. AARP thinks that the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolstered the system, lengthened the Medicare trust fund by 8 years. Benefits were not affected at all.  Jim, if I can just respond very quickly. First of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that, thats what they do. And so youve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that, and if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney is proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then theyre stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially, and thats why they were supportive of the approach that we took. One last point I want to make: We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare, but  but overall.  And so  Oh, is that a separate topic?  Im sorry.  Yes.  Absolutely.  No.  Well, I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasnt just on Wall Street. You had loan officers werethat were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldnt have been given because the folks didnt qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldnt afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1, great investments when they werent. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didnt even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said youve gotbanks, youve got to raise your capital requirements. You cant engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. Were going to make sure that youve got to have a living will so we can know how youre going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we dont have other taxpayer bailouts. In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid backevery single dimewith interest. Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and I appreciateand it appears weve got some agreement that a marketplace, to work, has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. Roll it back. And so the question is, does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But thats not what I believe.  Well, 4 years ago when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasnt just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldnt get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasnt just that this was the biggest driver of our Federal deficit, our overall health care cost. But it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sickmillions of families all across the country. If they had a preexisting condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, theyre paying their premiums; somebody gets really sick; lo and behold, they dont have enough money to pay the bills because the insurance companies say that theyve hit the limit. So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if youve got health insurance it doesnt mean a Government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies cant jerk you around. They cant impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insuranceyour insurance plan until youre 26 years old. And it also says that youre going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. Number two, if you dont have health insurance, were essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if youre out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. Now, the last point Id make before  No, I thinkI had 5 seconds before you interrupted me, was[laughter]. The irony is that weve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the State to set up what is essentially the identical model. And as consequence, people are covered there. It hasnt destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.  That I admit. [Laughter]  You did.  Please elaborate. [Laughter]  Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the Nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is we used the same advisers, and they say its the same plan. Itwhen Governor Romney talks about this board, for exampleunelected board that weve createdwhat this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall. Because there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves; to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured. And thats been the trend line. Or alternatively, we can figure out how do we make the cost of care more effective. And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care, cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They say if a patients coming in, lets get all the doctors together at once, do 1 test, instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Lets make sure that were providing preventive care so were catching the onset of something like diabetes. Lets pay providers on the basis of performance, as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures theyve engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says lets use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that when Obamacare is fully implemented, were going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last 2 years, health care premiums have gone up, its true, but theyve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So were already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, youre already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says we should replace itIm just going to repeal it, but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasnt described what exactly wed replace it with, other than saying were going to leave it to the States. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that hes offered, like letting you buy insurance across State lines, theres no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who has got a preexisting condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, its estimated that by repealing Obamacare, youre looking at 50 million people losing health insurance at a time when its vitally important.  No, thats not  They do.  Let me just point out, first of all, this board that were talking about cant make decisions about what treatments are given. Thats explicitly prohibited in the law. But lets go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well actually, Governor, that isnt what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate whats already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for 3 months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company cant deny you if youveif its been under 90 days. But thats already the law. And that doesnt help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. Theres a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasnt a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that, insurers, youve got to take everybody. Now, that also means that youve got more customers. But when Governor Romney says that hell replace it with something, but cant detail how it will be, in fact, replacedand the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isnt a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problemit just reminds me ofhe says that hes going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. Thats how its going to be paid for, but we dont know the details. He says that hes going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we dont know exactly which ones. He wont tell us. He now says hes going to replace Obamacare and assure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you dont have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because theyre too good? Is it because that somehow middle class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is because when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of preexisting conditions thenthese are tough problems, and weve got to make choices  and the choices weve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle class families all across the country.  Well, I definitely think there are differences. The first role of the Federal Government is to keep the American people safe. Thats its most basic function. And as Commander in Chief, that is something that I have worked on and thought about every single day that Ive been in the Oval Office. But I also believe that Government has the capacitythe Federal Governmenthas the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions. But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, lets help to finance the transcontinental railroad. Lets start the National Academy of Sciences. Lets start land-grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans. Because if all Americans are getting opportunity, were all going to be better off. That doesnt restrict peoples freedom; that enhances it. And so what Ive tried to do as President is to apply those same principles. When it comes to education, what Ive said is weve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. It wasnt a top-down approach, Governor. What weve said is, to States, well give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you have 46 States around the country who have made a real difference. But what Ive also said is lets hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed States right now cant all do that. In fact, weve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesnt think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the Federal Government can help. It cant do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence, well have a better trained workforce, and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where weve got a skilled workforce.  Well, as Ive indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, weve worked with Republican and Democratic Governors to initiate major reforms, and theyre having an impact right now.  This is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it were having to initiate significant cuts in Federal support for education, that makes a difference. His running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romneys talked about. And it wasnt very detailedthis seems to be a trendbut what it did do is to, if you extrapolated how much money were talking about, youd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent. When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things, I suspect, Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that theyre setting up their training programs  Let me just finish the point.  I suspect it will be a small agreement. Thewhere theyre partnering so that theyre designing training programs and people who are going through them know that theres a job waiting for them if they complete it.  That makes a big difference, but that requires some Federal support. Let me just usesay one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether its 2-year or 4-year, one of the things that I did as President was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed so there was no risk for the banks or the lenders. But they were taking billions out of the system. And we said why not cut out the middleman? And as a consequence, what weve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe, cares about education, but when he tells a student that you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, that indicates the degree to which there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver just dont have that option. And for us to be able to make sure that theyve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally importantnot just to those kids; its how were going to grow this economy over the long term.  Yes, he has a chance.  Jim, I  Look  Youve done a great job, Jim.  Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney is going to have a busy first day, because hes also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as youre sitting down with them. [Laughter] But look, my philosophy has been I will take ideas from everybodyDemocrat or Republicanas long as theyre advancing the cause of making middle class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. Thats how we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses. Thats how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasnt advancing that cause. Thats how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. Thats how we repealed dont ask, dont tell. Thats how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised. And thats how were going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Thats how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden. So weve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying Ill sit down, but you have to have a plan. Number two, whats important is occasionally youve got to say no to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And yes, we had some fights between me and the Republicans when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. When we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no? Yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.  And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And Ive got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.  Well, Jim, I want to thank you. And I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think this was a terrific debate and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver. Four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people. Because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that shes gotten. Because of a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didnt lay off workers during a recession. The autoworkers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride that theyre helping to build America. And so the question now is, how do we build on those strengths? And everything that Ive tried to do and everything that Im now proposing for the next 4 years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that were closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our futureall those things are designed to make sure that the American peopletheir genius, their grit, their determination is channeled and they have an opportunity to succeed and everybodys getting a fair shot and everybodys getting a fair shareeverybodys doing a fair share and everybodys playing by the same rules. \"\"\",\"\"\" Well, sure, Id like to clear up the record and go through piece by piece. First of all, I dont have a $5 trillion tax cut. I dont have a tax cut of the scale that youre talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But Im not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. Theyll do fine whether youre President or I am. The people who are having a hard time right now are middle-income Americans. Under the Presidents policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. Theyre just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a tax in and of itself. Ill call it the economy tax. Its been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the President, electric rates are up, food prices are up, health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is, how to get them going again? And Ive described it. Its energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget, and helping small business. Those are the cornerstones of my plan. But the President mentioned a couple of other ideas Ill just note. First, education. I agree education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, weve got 47 of them housed in the Federal Government, reporting to 8 different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. Weve got to get those dollars back to the States and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation. We agree we ought to bring the tax rates down, and I do: both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue and have the Government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the President pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up, but not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on Government land. On Government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If Im President, Ill double them and also get the oil from offshore in Alaska, and Ill bring that pipeline in from Canada. And by the way, I like coal. Im going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like its getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, Im not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the revenues going to the Government. My number-one principle is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden paidbeing paid by middle-income Americans. And to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.  But I getright, right.  Yes. Well, but virtually virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.  So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, Id say, absolutely not. Im not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What Ive said is, I wont put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. Thats part one. So theres no economist can say Mitt Romneys tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. And number three, I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you described and say its completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said youre going to raise taxes by 3 to $4,000 on middle-income families. Throw all these studies out there. But lets get to the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time, lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is, because small business pays that individual rate. Fifty-four percent of Americas workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. . This is about getting jobs for the American people.  Jim, let me just come back on that point, which is these small businesses were talking about  Its fun, isnt it?  Thats good.  You bet. President, youreMr. President, youre absolutely right, which is that with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, theyre taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ halfhalfof all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. Now, I talked to a guy who has a very small business. Hes in the electronics business in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes: Federal income tax, Federal payroll tax, State income tax, State sales tax, State property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I dont want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the wayget the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions to create more jobsbecause theres nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. Thats by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.  Jim, the President began this segment, so I think I get the last word. So Im going to take it.  Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word of that segment. Well, I hope. Let me just make this comment.  Let me repeat what I said.  Im not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. Thats not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. Thats point one. So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but thats not my plan. Number two, lets look at history. My plan is not like anything thats been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. Theyre suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last 4 years. Its absolutely extraordinary. Weve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. Its justweve gotwhen the President took office, 32 million people on food stamps, 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.  You bet.  Well, good. Im glad you raised that, and its a critical issue. I think its not just an economic issue. I think its a moral issue. I think its frankly not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to passed on to the next generation, and theyre going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt were adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number three is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, theyre paying taxes and you can get the job done that way. The President would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth and you can never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test if they dont pass it: Is the program so critical its worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, Ill get rid of it. Obamacare is on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect.  Good. Okay, good. So Ill get rid of that. Im sorry, Jim, Im going to stop the subsidy to PBS. Im going to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big Bird. I actually like you too. But Im not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it. Thats number one. Number two, Ill take programs that are currently good programs, but, I think, could be run more efficiently at the State level and send them to the State. Number three, Ill make Government more efficient. Were going to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way. This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The President said hed cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last 4 years. The President has put in place as much public debtalmost as much debt held by the public as all prior Presidents combined.  Simpson-Bowles, the President should have grabbed that.  I have my own plan. Its not the same as Simpson-Bowles. But in my view, the President should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.  But youve been President 4 years  Youve been President 4 years. You said youd cut the deficit in half. Its now 4 years later; we still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says well have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next 4 years. If youre reelected, well get to a trillion-dollar debt. But you have said before youd cut the deficit in half. And this fourI love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts: You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesnt get the job done. Let me come back and say, why is that I dont want to raise taxes? Why dont I want to raise taxes on people? And actually you said it. Back in 2010, you said, look, Im going to extend the tax policies that we have. Now, Im not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy is growing slow like this, when were in recession, you shouldnt raise taxes on anyone. Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, its growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just dont want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is, its not just wealthy peopleyou mentioned Donald Trumpits not just Donald Trump youre taxing. Its all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America, these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes, and you kill jobs. Thats why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I dont want to kill jobs in this environment. Ill make one more point.  Okay.  Absolutely. Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. Thats how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, youll never get there. You never balance the budget by raising taxes. SpainSpain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. Were now spending 42 percent of our economy on Government. I dont want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because theyre working.  Jim, letsweve gone on a lot of topics there. And so its going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools to oil to tax breaks and companies going overseas. So lets go through them one by one. First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And its actually an accounting treatment, as you know, thats been in place for a hundred years. Now  And in 1 year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but thats about 50 years worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil; actually, those $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth. But you know if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why, that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course, its on the table. Thats probably not going to survive if you get that rate down to 25 percent. But dont forget, you put $90 billionlike 50 years worth of breaksinto solar and wind: to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you dont just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers. All right? So this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure. The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas, look, Ive been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what youre talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant. . But the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. What we do have right now is a setting where Id like to bring money from overseas back to this country. And finally, Medicaid to States, Im not quite sure where that came in except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to States and say to a State, youre going to get what you got last year plus inflation, plus 1 percent. And then, youre going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best. And I remember as a Governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the GovernorsRepublican and Democratssaid, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the Federal Government tell us how to care for our poor. So let Statesone of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that States are the laboratories of democracy. Dont have the Federal Government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let States do this. And by the way, if a State gets in trouble, well, we could step in and see if we could find a way to help them.  But the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and States, not the Federal Government.  Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know any time we talk about entitlements people become concerned that something is going to happen thats going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is, neither the President, nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near-retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if youre 60 or around 60 or older, you dont need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurringoh, I just thought about one, and that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the President isnt proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact, he is on Medicare. On Social Security, hes not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, hes cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually, just going to them and saying were going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody is going to get a lower rate, thats not just going after places where theres abuse. Thats saying, were cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they wont take any more Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they wont take more Medicare patients. Thiswe have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I cant understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, youd point out, well, were putting some back, were going to give a better prescription program. Thats one ofthats $1 for every 15 youve cut. Theyre smart enough to know thats not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion youve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, Ive got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.  Again, thats for future people, right not for current retirees.  What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the President supports taking $716 billion out of that program.  So thats number one.  Number two is, for people coming along that are young, what Id do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan, their choice. They get toand theyll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they dont have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000; thats not going to happen. Theyll have at least two plans. And by the way, if the Government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare. Or theyll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is, Id rather have a private plan. Id just as soon not have the Government telling me what kind of health care I get. Id rather be able to have an insurance company. If I dont like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people will make their own choice. The other thing we have to do to save Medicare, we have to have the benefits high for those that are low income. But for higher-income people, were going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. Thats the plan that I put forward. And by the way, the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or Senator Wyden, who is a coauthor of the bill with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill Clintons Chief of Staff. This is an idea thats been around a long time, which is saying, hey, lets see if we cant get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.  Thats a big topic. Can we stay on Medicare?  Lets get back to Medicare.  Lets get back to Medicare.  The President said that the Government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.  If thats the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase. But my experience  my experience is the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Regulation is essential. You cant have a free market work if you dont have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to haveI needed to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldnt have people opening up banks in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.  Well, in some places, yes  other places, no. It can become out of date. And whats happened with some of the legislation thats been passed during the Presidents term, youve seen regulation become excessive, and its hurt the economy. Let me give you an example. Dodd-Frank was passed, and it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and theyre effectively guaranteed by the Federal Government. This is the biggest kiss thats been given to New York banks Ive ever seen.  This is an enormous boon for them. There have been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd-Frank. So theres one example. Heres another. In Dodd-Frank, it says if  Well, I would repeal theand replace it. Were not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation  and there are some parts of DoddFrank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency. You need to have leverage limits for institutional  But lets mention  Let me mention the other one. Lets talk the other big onethe big one.  Okay. Sorry, Jim but thats just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. Thats why Id have regulation. But I wouldnt designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. Thats one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasnt thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because its killing regional and small banks. Theyre getting hurt. Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who werent qualified. Thats exactly right. Its one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage thats not qualified, there are big penaltiesexcept they didnt ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage was.  Its been 2 years. We dont know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. Its hurt the housing market, because Dodd-Frank. didnt anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. Its not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didnt come out with a clear regulation. . I will make sure we dont hurt the functioning of our marketplace and our businesses, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.  I sure do. Well, in part it comes, again, from my experience. I was in New Hampshire; a woman came to me and she said, look, I cant afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, were thinking of dropping our insurance; we cant afford it. And the number of small businesses Ive gone to that are saying theyre dropping insurance because they cant afford itthe cost of health care is just prohibitive, and weve got to deal with cost. And unfortunately, when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So its adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the President ran for office, he said that by this year he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, its gone up by that amount. So its expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So thats one reason I dont want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board thats going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I dont like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country. It said, whats been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said, it makes us less likely to hire people. I just dont know how the President could have come into office facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for 2 years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my State: craft a plan at the State level that fits the needs of the State, and then lets focus on getting the cost down for people rather than raising it with a $2,500 additional premium.  Well, I did with my first statement but Ill go on.  Ill elaborate, exactly right. First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my State, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinaryelected a Republican Senatorto stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. What we did in a legislature 87-percent Democrat, we worked together. Two hundred legislators in my legislature; only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didnt raise taxes. Youve raised them by a trillion dollars under Obamacare. We didnt cut Medicareof course, we dont have Medicarebut we didnt cut Medicare by $716 billion. We didnt put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments theyre going to receive. We didnt also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put people in a position where theyre going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasonsfor the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurancethis is why the American people dont want Medicaredont want Obamacare. Its why Republicans said, do not do this. And the Republicans had ahad the plan. They put a plan out. They put a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important, has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a President who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.  Well, actually, its a lengthy description, but number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. Thats already offered in the private marketplace. You dont have the Government mandate that for that to occur. But lets come back to something the President and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so its more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the Governmentan unelected board, appointed boardwho are going to decide what kind of treatments you ought to have.  In my opinion, the Government is not effective in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the costs than the Government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are smallthese are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businessesexcuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we dont need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job for keeping costs down. And thats happening; Intermountain Healthcare does it superbly well.  Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the Federal Government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. Thats the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.  No, I have to respond to that  which is, my experience as a Governor is if I come in and lay down a piece of legislation and say its my way or the highway, I dont get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip ONeill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. Youve said the same thing; youre going to simplify the Tax Code, broaden the base. Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families, and Im going to work together with Congress to say, okay, what are the various ways we can bring down deductions, for instance. One way, for instance, would be to have a single numbermake up a number25,000, $50,000anybody could have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high income people. Thats one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the Code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my preexisting condition plan. You obviously have studied up on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with preexisting conditions; thats part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the Nation, State by State. And I said that at that time. The Federal Government taking over health care for the entire Nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives States the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.  Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number 1 of all 50 States. And the key to great schoolsgreat teachers. So I reject the idea that I dont believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every State should make that decision on their own. The role of Government: Look behind usthe Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of Government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty: We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of Americas military. Second, in that line that says, We are endowed by our Creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our Creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and cant care for themselves are cared byby one another. Were a nation that believes that we are all children of the same God, and we care for those that have difficulties. Those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled, we care for them. And we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the Government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what were seeing right now is, in my view, a trickle-down Government approach which has Government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams, and its not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is one out of six people in poverty. The proof of that is weve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year cant find work. We know that the path were taking is not working. Its time for a new path.  Well, the primary responsibility for education is, of course, at the State and local level. But the Federal Government also can play a very important role. And I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, hessome ideas hes put forward on Race to the Topnot all of them, but some of them I agree with and congratulate him for pursuing that. The Federal Government can get local and State schools to do a better job. My own view, by the way, is Ive added to that. I happen to believeI want the kids that are getting Federal dollars from IDEA or title Ithese are disabled kids or poor kidsor lower income kids, ratherI want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. So all Federal funds, instead of going to the State or to the school district, Id have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their student.  Oh, sure. Oh, yes. Its, by the way, going very well in my State, by the way. Yes.  Jim, Jim  Mr. President, youre entitled, as the President, to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts[laughter]all right? Im not going to cut education funding. I dont have any plan to cut education funding. And grants that go to people going to college Im planning on continuing to grow, so Im not planning on making changes there. But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into green jobs. And Ilook, Im all in favor of green energy. Ninety billionthat would have hired 2 million teachers. Ninety billion dollars. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business. I think about half of themof the ones that have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happen to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for Americas Governmentwe were talking about the role of Governmentis not to become the economic player picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for Government is to say, how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Lets grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a school thats being more successful. I dont want to cut our commitment to education. I want to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, Ive had that experience. I dont just talk about it. Ive been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the Nation. This is not because I didnt have commitment to education. Its because I care about education for all of our kids.  Jim, I had the great experienceit didnt seem like it at the timeof being elected in a State where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out, from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the Nation. We cut taxes 19 times.  As President, I will sit down on day oneactually, the day after I get elected, Ill sit down with leaders, the Democratic leaders as well as Republican leaders, and continueas we did in my Statewe met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in our State in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because were going to compromise our principle, but because theres common ground. And the challenges America faces right nowlook, the reason Im in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we facethis deficit could crush the future generations. Whats happening in the Middle East; there are developments around the world that are of real concern. And Republicans and Democrats both love America, but we need to have leadership, leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if its a Republican or a Democrat. Ive done it before. Ill do it again.  Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening. This is athis is an important election, and Im concerned about America. Im concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last 4 years. I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. Its bigger than our respective parties. Its an election about the course of America: what kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children. And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening. And over the course of this month were going to have two more Presidential debates and a Vice Presidential debate; well talk about those paths. But they lead in very different directions. And its not just looking to our words that you have to take into evidence of where they go; you can look at the record. Theres no question in my mind that if the President were to be reelected, youll continue to a see a middle class squeeze, with incomes going down and prices going up. Ill get incomes up again. Youll see chronic unemployment. Weve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If Im President, I will createhelp create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes. If the Presidents reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view, thats going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. Youre going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family. If Im elected, we wont have Obamacare. Well put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own State and allow each State to craft their own programs to get people insured, and well focus on getting the cost of health care down. If the President were to be reelected, youre going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. Youll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. Youll have hospitals and providers that will no longer accept Medicare patients. Ill restore that $716 billion to Medicare. And finally, military. If the Presidents reelected, youll see dramatic cuts to our military. The Secretary of Defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get Americas middle class working again. Thank you, Jim. \"\"\",\"\"\"This debate and the next threetwo Presidential, one Vice Presidentialare sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the Commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments, with 2-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment. Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the Commission or the candidates. The segments, as I announced in advance, will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of Government, and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics, and choices. Both candidates will also have 2-minute closing statements. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy, distracting things so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney. Gentlemen, welcome to you both. Lets start the economy, segment one, and lets begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs? You have 2 minuteseach of you have 2 minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.  Governor Romney, 2 minutes.  Mr. President, please respond directly to what the Governor just said about trickle downhis trickle-down approach, as he said yours is.  Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things. And were going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can. But first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that youd like to ask the President directly about something he just said?  Mr. President.  All right, what is the difference? Lets just stay on taxes for a  Lets just stay on taxes for a moment here.  What is the difference?  All right. Go ahead.  All right, thats where we started.  Yes. Do you challenge what the Governor just said about his own plan?  All right.  Just for the record  Excuse me, just so everybody understands, were way over our first 15 minutes.  Its okay. Its great.  Great, no problem. As long as you all dont have a problem, I dont have a problem.  Because were still on the economy. Were going to come back to taxes, and were going to move on to the deficit and a lot of other things too. But go ahead, sir.  Well, youre going to get the first part in the next segment.  Thats not how it works.  All right.  All right, lets talk specifics. Were still on the economy. This is theoretically now a second segment, still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the Federal deficit, the Federal debt. And the questionyou each have 2 minutes on this. And Governor Romney, you go first because the President went first on segment one. And the question is this: What are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?  Mr. President, 2 minutes.  Simpson-Bowles  Mr. President, sorry. Way over the 2 minutes.  Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Will you support Simpson-Bowles?  No, I mean do you support -Simpson-Bowles?  Lets let him answer the taxes thing for a moment.  Mr. President.  No, about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.  Is thatthats true, right? Completely? Okay.  Yes, but, Mr. President, youre saying in order to get the job done, its got to be balanced.  Come back to Medicaid, yes.  Lets just  Lets go. Two seconds  Two seconds and were going on, still on the economy, but another part of it. All right, this is segment three, the economy. Entitlements, first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?  Well follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have 2 minutes on Social Security and entitlements.  Mr. President.  And you dont support that?  Well talk aboutspecifically about health care in a moment. But whatdo you support the voucher system, Governor?  What about the voucher  All right.  Okay.  Well talk about that in a minute.  Okay.  Yes, were going toyes, I want to get to it.  But all I want to do is very quickly before we leave the economy  No, no, no  All right.  Wait a minute, Governor. Wait  Can wecan the two of you agree that the voters have a choice, a clear choice between the two of you on Medicare?  All right. So to finish quickly, briefly on the economy, what is your view about the level of Federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is thereshould there be more? Beginning with youthis is not a new 2-minute segment. Just start, and well go for a few minutes, and then were going to go to health care, okay?  Is it successing now, do you think?  Like where? Let me know. Give me  You want to repeal Dodd-Frank?  Okay. All right.  Well, theres a specific  Lets get to theexcuse me  No, no, lets not.  Lets let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the Governor just said.  All right  Okay  All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now lets move to health care, where I know there is a clear difference[laughter]and that has to do with the Affordable Care ActObamacare. And its a 2-minute new segment, and that means 2 minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney. You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?  Mr. President, the argument against repeal.  Two minutes is up, sir.  Your 5 seconds went away a long time ago. [Laughter]  All right, Governor, tell the President directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare.  Lets let the Governor explain what you would do if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it? What do you have in mind?  All right. Lets  Were going to move to  Well, but  That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and its the role of Government. And lets see, role of Government, and it isyou are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this: Do you believeboth of you, but you have the first 2 minutes on this, Mr. Presidentdo you believe theres a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the Federal Government?  Two minutes, Governor, on the role of Government. Your view?  All right, lets go through some specifics in terms of whathow each of you views the role of Government. How doeducation: Does the Federal Government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?  How do you see the Federal Governments responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?  Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney onabout education and the Federal Government?  Do you agree, Governor?  Okay, now  Were running out of time, gentlemen . so I think you have a chanceyes, respond to that. Yes, sir, Governor.  All right, gentlemen  Excuse me, one second.  Excuse me, sir. Weve gotwe barely have 3 minutes left. Im not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or Ive done a poor job  Oh, well, no. But the fact is, Governmentthe role of Government and governingweve lost a pod, in other words. So we only have 3 minutes left in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask, finally, hereand remember, weve got 3 minutes total time here. And the question is this: Many of the legislative functions of the Federal Government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your caseif reelected, in your casewhat would you do about that? Governor?  What would you do as President?  Mr. President.  All right  That brings us to closing statements. There was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last. So you have a closing 2 minutes, Mr. President.  Governor Romney, your 2-minute closing.  Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Mr. President. The next debate will be the Vice Presidential event on Thursday, October 11, at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, Im Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 15 2008,Senator Obama,Senator McCain,\"\"\" Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and its wonderful to join Sen. McCain again, and thank you, Bob.I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And the financial rescue plan that Sen. McCain and I supported is an important first step. And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if theyre putting money up. Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.And I think that its going to take some time to work itself out. But what we havent yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class. Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis. So Ive proposed four specific things that I think can help.Number one, lets focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company thats creating a job right here in America.Number two, lets help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and lets allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if theyre experiencing a crisis.Now Sen. McCain and I agree with your idea that weve got to help homeowners. Thats why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.I disagree with Sen. McCain in how to do it, because the way Sen. McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if were buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less. And we dont want to waste taxpayer money. And weve got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.Last point I want to make, though. Weve got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with. Weve got to fix our energy policy thats giving our wealth away. Weve got to fix our health care system and weve got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn. He has been watching ads of Sen. McCains. Let me tell you what Im actually going to do. I think tax policy is a major difference between Sen. McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.Now, Sen. McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.What Ive said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime.And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut. In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Sen. McCain does.Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesnt yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now. And that requires us to make some important choices.The last point Ill make about small businesses. Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy. They produce the most jobs. OK. Can I... If I can answer the question. Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans. Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order... ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- theyre trying to figure out how theyre going to afford food, how theyre going to save for their kids college education, they need a break.So, look, nobody likes taxes. I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself. But ultimately, weve got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebodys got to do it. Well, I dont mind paying a little more. Well, first of all, I think its important for the American public to understand that the $750 billion rescue package, if its structured properly, and, as president, I will make sure its structured properly, means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back, and thats important to understand.But there is no doubt that weve been living beyond our means and were going to have to make some adjustments.Now, what Ive done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut. I havent made a promise about... Absolutely. So let me get to that. What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go. Every dollar that Ive proposed, Ive proposed an additional cut so that it matches.And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies. It doesnt -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesnt help seniors get any better. Its not improving our health care system. Its just a giveaway.We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that dont work. And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that dont work, we should cut. Programs that we need, we should make them work better.Now, what is true is that Sen. McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people. I mentioned health care earlier.If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money were borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.But what is absolutely true is that, once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump, that were not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways.And were going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means. Well, look, I think that we do have a disagreement about an across-the-board spending freeze. It sounds good. Its proposed periodically. It doesnt happen.And, in fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel, because there are some programs that dont work at all. There are some programs that are underfunded. And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.Now, Sen. McCain talks a lot about earmarks. Thats one of the centerpieces of his campaign.Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. Theres no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But its not going to solve the problem.Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what were doing going forward.When President Bush came into office, we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $5 trillion. It has doubled over the last eight years. And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars.So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. And, frankly, Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of President Bushs budgets.Weve got to take this in a new direction, thats what I propose as president. Well, theres a lot of stuff that was put out there, so let me try to address it. First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasnt very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party. I support... I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers. Doesnt make me popular with the teachers union. I support clean coal technology. Doesnt make me popular with environmentalists. So Ive got a history of reaching across the aisle.Now with respect to a couple of things Sen. McCain said, the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Sen. McCain keeps on making.Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesnt happen very often when it comes to accusations about me. So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bushs policies, its because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.Now, youve shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that. But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what youre proposing is eight more years of the same thing. And it hasnt worked.And I think the American people understand it hasnt worked. We need to move in a new direction. Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough. I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Sen. McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine.And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative. It absolutely is true. And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply.And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like were having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy. Thats the stuff that campaigns should be made of.The notion, though, that because were not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I dont mind being attacked for the next three weeks.What the American people cant afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies. And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about whats most pressing to them: the economic crisis.Sen. McCains own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.And that is something that I would welcome. But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America. Congratulations. I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaigns awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like terrorist and kill him, and that youre running mate didnt mention, didnt stop, didnt say Hold on a second, thats kind of out of line.And I think Congressman Lewis point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.Now... Let -- let -- let... Let me -- let me complete... ... my response. I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement, and we immediately put out a statement saying that we dont think that comparison is appropriate.And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth. And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and thats what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign. We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we... ... talking about it this evening. But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then were not talking about issues. What were talking about... John, I... Well, look, Bob, as I said... You know, heres what I would say. I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each others campaigns. I suspect we wont agree here tonight.What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that were facing, if were going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if were going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, were going to have to be able to work together.And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable. And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues. What we cant do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people. And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long. And I think... Bob, I think its going to be important to just -- Ill respond to these two particular allegations that Sen. McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention.In fact, Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Sen. McCains campaign over the last two or three weeks. This has been their primary focus. So lets get the record straight. Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts. Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagans former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign. He has never been involved in this campaign. And he will not advise me in the White House. So thats Mr. Ayers.Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization. Apparently what theyve done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didnt really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.It had nothing to do with us. We were not involved. The only involvement Ive had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.Now, the reason I think that its important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Sen. McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.Let me tell you who I associate with. On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. If Im interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House. And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Sen. McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me. Thats absolutely not true. And thats not the facts. Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country. Its not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody. And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.But its also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what its like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy. Thats what hes done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.Thats what hes done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Womens Act. Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what were going to have to do is to re-prioritize, make sure that were investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Bidens always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me. You know, I think its -- thats going to be up to the American people. I think that, obviously, shes a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.And I think its very commendable the work shes done on behalf of special needs. I agree with that, John.I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if were going to get serious in terms of research. That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.And if we have an across-the-board spending freeze, were not going to be able to do it. Thats an example of, I think, the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that were funding some of those programs. I think that in ten years, we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela. I think thats about a realistic timeframe.And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face. Obviously, weve got an immediate crisis right now. But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia. Its mortgaging our childrens future.Now, from the start of this campaign, Ive identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that theyre not drilling, use them or lose them.And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil. But understand, we only have three to four percent of the worlds oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil, which means that we cant drill our way out of the problem.Thats why Ive focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal. These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car thats built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on.Now I just want to make one last point because Sen. McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue. I believe in free trade. But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Sen. McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement. And NAFTA doesnt have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable. In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.And when it comes to South Korea, weve got a trade agreement up right now, they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States. Thats all good. We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea. That is not free trade. Weve got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that. Let me respond. Actually, I understand it pretty well. The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isnt being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.But I think that the important point is weve got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.And the last point Ill make, because we started on energy. When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now. They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices. And now with the financial crisis, car dealerships are closing and people cant get car loans.Thats why I think its important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers, but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel-efficient cars of the future.And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done. Its going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century. Weve got to do both, and thats exactly what my plan does.Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again. Just yesterday, I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line. Two women, both of them probably in their mid- to late-50s, had just been laid off of their plant. Neither of them have health insurance.And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, theyre worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.So heres what my plan does. If you have health insurance, then you dont have to do anything. If youve got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan.The only thing were going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you. And we estimate we can cut the average familys premium by about $2,500 per year.If you dont have health insurance, then what were going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Sen. McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.Were going to make sure that insurance companies cant discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions. Well negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented. Weve got to put more money into preventive care.This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but its also how were going to save the federal budget, because we cant afford these escalating costs. It is not and I didnt describe it... I just... I just described what my plan is. And Im happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if youre out there. Heres your fine -- zero. You wont pay a fine, because... Zero, because as I said in our last debate and Ill repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty. But large businesses that can afford it, weve got a choice. Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or theyre going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.So heres what we do. We exempt small businesses. In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, well give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.If you dont have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan, you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described.Now, what we havent talked about is Sen. McCains plan. He says hes going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit. That sounds pretty good. And you can go out and buy your own insurance.Heres the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance. This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.Older folks, lets healthy folks, whats going to end up happening is that youre going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers wont be able to afford it.And once youre out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Sen. McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.And this is your plan, John. For the first time in history, you will be taxing peoples health care benefits.By the way, the average policy costs about $12,000. So if youve got $5,000 and its going to cost you $12,000, thats a loss for you.Last point about Sen. McCains plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Sen. McCains plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care. Very briefly. You all just heard my plan. If youve got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it. Now, under Sen. McCains plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care.Thats the choice youll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care. And dont take my word for it. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesnt support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.All I want to do, if youve already got health care, is lower your costs. That includes you, Joe. Well, I think its true that we shouldnt apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.Now I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldnt be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.Ill just give you one quick example. Sen. McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, its taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didnt know about it until fairly recently.We tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.I think that its important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And thats the kind of judge that I want. Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, thats because its not true. The -- here are the facts.There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as theres an exception for the mothers health and life, and this did not contain that exception.And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and thats why I voted present, because Im willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that -- look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views.But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think thats where we can find some common ground, because nobodys pro-abortion. I think its always a tragic situation.We should try to reduce these circumstances. This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because theres never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.So weve got to get our education system right. Now, typically, whats happened is that theres been a debate between more money or reform, and I think we need both.In some cases, we are going to have to invest. Early childhood education, which closes the achievement gap, so that every child is prepared for school, every dollar we invest in that, we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores, reduced dropout rates, reduced delinquency rates.I think its going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability.And I think its important for us to make college affordable. Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if theyre going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and its very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that theyre going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house.And thats why Ive proposed a $4,000 tuition credit, every student, every year, in exchange for some form of community service, whether its military service, whether its Peace Corps, whether its working in a community.If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system.But theres one last ingredient that I just want to mention, and thats parents. We cant do it just in the schools. Parents are going to have to show more responsibility. Theyve got to turn off the TV set, put away the video games, and, finally, start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need. Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and thats a tradition that has served us well. But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.Now we tried to do this under President Bush. He put forward No Child Left Behind. Unfortunately, they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind. And local school districts end up having more of a burden, a bunch of unfunded mandates, the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs, but we never followed through on the promise of funding, and that left local school districts very cash-strapped.So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support. Sen. McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions. I think its important to foster competition inside the public schools.And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves, if they cant hack it, then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future.Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system. And I also have to disagree on Sen. McCains record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability.Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he didnt seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was, well, you know, we cant give money to every interest group that comes along.I dont think Americas youth are interest groups, I think theyre our future. And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize. We cant say were going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how were going to pay for it.And if were going to do some of the things you mentioned, like lowering loan rates or what have you, somebody has got to pay for it. Its not going to happen on its own. Ill just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C. Sen. McCains absolutely right: The D.C. school system is in terrible shape, and it has been for a very long time. And weve got a wonderful new superintendent there whos working very hard with the young mayor there to try... ... who initiated -- actually, supports charters. But the -- but heres the thing, is that, even if Sen. McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesnt show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Sen. McCains education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots.That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Sen. McCain.So if we are going to be serious about this issue, weve got to have a president who is going to tackle it head-on. And thats what I intend to do as president. Well, I want to thank Sen. McCain and Bob for moderating.I think we all know America is going through tough times right now. The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washingtons unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.And thats why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that weve seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.We need fundamental change in this country, and thats what Id like to bring.You know, over the last 20 months, youve invited me into your homes. Youve shared your stories with me. And youve confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people.And thats why Im sure that our brighter days are still ahead.But were going to have to invest in the American people again, in tax cuts for the middle class, in health care for all Americans, and college for every young person who wants to go. In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future. In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.These are the policies I have fought for my entire career. And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.But its not going to be easy. Its not going to be quick. It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats, Republicans, independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility.Im absolutely convinced we can do it. I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children.Thank you very much.\"\"\",\"\"\" Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you.And thanks to Hofstra.And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you.Its good to see you again, Sen. Obama.Americans are hurting right now, and theyre angry. Theyre hurting, and theyre angry. Theyre innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And theyre angry, and they have every reason to be angry.And they want this country to go in a new direction. And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I wont repeat.But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes.Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.Now, we have allocated $750 billion. Lets take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.Now, I know the criticism of this.Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes? That paid their mortgage payments? It doesnt help that person in their home if the next door neighbors house is abandoned. And so weve got to reverse this. We ought to put the homeowners first. And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority. No. I would like to mention that a couple days ago Sen. Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy whos a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.Now Sen. Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, Ill not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and Ill keep your taxes low and Ill provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees.And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income. Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses. Thats 16 million jobs in America. And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business. Thats what Joe believes. You know, when Sen. Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around. In other words, were going to take Joes money, give it to Sen. Obama, and let him spread the wealth around.I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around. You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.The whole premise behind Sen. Obamas plans are class warfare, lets spread the wealth around. I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that were talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.Who -- why would you want to increase anybodys taxes right now? Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around.Im not going to... Were not going to do that in my administration. Were talking about Joe the plumber. Nobody likes taxes. Lets not raise anybodys taxes. OK? The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world. Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent. Ireland, its 11 percent.Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?We need to cut the business tax rate in America. We need to encourage business.Now, of all times in America, we need to cut peoples taxes. We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around. Well, thank you, Bob. I just want to get back to this home ownership. During the Depression era, we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation.And they went out and bought up these mortgages. And people were able to stay in their homes, and eventually the values of those homes went up, and they actually made money.And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Sen. Clinton not too long ago.So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth. But -- OK. All right. Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence. We have to have nuclear power. We have to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that dont like us very much. Its wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Sen. Obama has opposed.And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America.OK, what -- what would I cut? I would have, first of all, across-the-board spending freeze, OK? Some people say thats a hatchet. Thats a hatchet, and then I would get out a scalpel, OK?Because weve got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- weve got to have a new direction for this country. We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society.Government spending has gone completely out of control; $10 trillion dollar debt were giving to our kids, a half-a-trillion dollars we owe China.I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending. I know how to eliminate programs. I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Sen. Obama supported those subsidies.I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane-based ethanol from Brazil.I know how to save billions. I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail.But I would fight for a line-item veto, and I would certainly veto every earmark pork-barrel bill. Sen. Obama has asked for nearly $1 billion in pork-barrel earmark projects... ... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown. Thats not the way we cut -- well cut out all the pork. Sure I do. And let me tell you... Yes. Sen. Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago. Im going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.Sen. Obama talks about voting for budgets. He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $42,000 a year. Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget. Its completely out of control.The mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg, just imposed an across- the-board spending freeze on New York City. Theyre doing it all over America because they have to. Because they have to balance their budgets. I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will... ... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.Now, look, Americans are hurting tonight and theyre angry and I understand that, and they want a new direction. I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending.Sen. Obama talks about the budgets I voted for. He voted for the last two budgets that had that $24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed.He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed. So the fact is, lets look at our records, Sen. Obama. Lets look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations.I have fought against spending. I have fought against special interests. I have fought for reform. You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue. An overwhelming vote. Let me just say, Bob. OK. But its very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration. I have disagreed with leaders of my own party. Ive got the scars to prove it.Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time. Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks, whether it be the issue of torture, whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs, importation. Whether it be fighting for an HMO patients bill of rights. Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate. Sen. Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isnt very convincing. Well, this has been a tough campaign. Its been a very tough campaign. And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Sen. Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.When Sen. Obama was first asked, he said, Any place, any time, the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas. So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.And the fact is, its gotten pretty tough. And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns. But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- Ive written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace. That, to me, was so hurtful.And, Sen. Obama, you didnt repudiate those remarks. Every time theres been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them. I hope that Sen. Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign. This is a tough campaign. And its a matter of fact that Sen. Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history. And I can prove it.And, Sen. Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didnt keep your word.And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Sen. Clinton and said, I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision, you didnt tell the American people the truth because you didnt.And thats -- thats -- thats an unfortunate part. Now we have the highest spending by Sen. Obamas campaign than any time since Watergate. Its not true. Well, if youll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan. And any objective observer has said its not true. Youre running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research. I dont.Youre running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration. So the fact is that Sen. Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.And of course, Ive been talking about the economy. Of course, Ive talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that Im not going to spread his wealth around. Im going to let him keep his wealth. And of course, were talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.Thats what my campaign is all about and thats what itll continue to be all about.But again, I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman... Youve got to read what he said...(CROSSTALK) Youve got to read what he said. I cannot... We do and I hope... Sure. Well, let me just say I would... Let me just say categorically Im proud of the people that come to our rallies. Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, youre going to have some fringe peoples. You know that. And Ive -- and weve always said that thats not appropriate.But to somehow say that group of young women who said Military wives for McCain are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Im not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and theyre great citizens.And Im not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- theres a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies, Sen. Obama, that Im not happy about either.In fact, some T-shirts that are very... ... unacceptable. So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someones been out of line, whether theyve been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on. I havent. Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question. Yes, real quick. Mr. Ayers, I dont care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Sen. Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.We need to know the full extent of Sen. Obamas relationship with ACORN, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy. The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $832,000 for lighting and site selection. So all of these things need to be examined, of course. Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN. So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers living room. And the facts are facts and records are records. And its not the fact -- its not the fact that Sen. Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him. Its the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Sen. Obamas relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America. And thats what my campaign is about and Im not going to raise taxes the way Sen. Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy. And thats really what this campaign is going to be about. Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin. They know that shes a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America.Shes a reformer. She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor. When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board, she saw corruption, she resigned and said, This cant go on.Shes given money back to the taxpayers. Shes cut the size of government. She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas thats going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.Shes a reformer through and through. And its time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nations capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism thats been so much a part of it that Ive fought against for all these years.Shell be my partner. She understands reform. And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families. She understands that autism is on the rise, that weve got to find out whats causing it, and weve got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.She understands that better than almost any American that I know. Im proud of her.And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process. And I cant tell how proud I am of her and her family.Her husbands a pretty tough guy, by the way, too. I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects. But I do point out that hes been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength.He voted against the first Gulf War. He voted against it and, obviously, we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it wouldve threatened the Middle Eastern world supply.In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries. Were seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but were seeing them. Were now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I open and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and hes been wrong on a number of the major ones.But again, I want to come back to, notice every time Sen. Obama says, We need to spend more, we need to spend more, thats the answer -- why do we always have to spend more?Why cant we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government? Maybe thats why hes asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise peoples taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families. Climate change. I think we can, for all intents and purposes, eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil. Canadian oil is fine.By the way, when Sen. Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, Yes, and well sell our oil to China.You dont tell countries youre going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them.We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants, power plants, right away. We can store and we can reprocess.Sen. Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe.Look, weve sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them. We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Sen. Obama, no problem.So the point is with nuclear power, with wind, tide, solar, natural gas, with development of flex fuel, hybrid, clean coal technology, clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America thats hurting rather badly.So I think we can easily, within seven, eight, ten years, if we put our minds to it, we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we dont achieve our independence. Well, you know, I admire so much Sen. Obamas eloquence. And you really have to pay attention to words. He said, we will look at offshore drilling. Did you get that? Look at. We can offshore drill now. Weve got to do it now. We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own. Its doable. The technology is there and we have to drill now.Now, on the subject of free trade agreements. I am a free trader. And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work, going to our community colleges.But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Sen. Obama opposes. Right now, because of previous agreements, some made by President Clinton, the goods and products that we send to Colombia, which is our largest agricultural importer of our products, is -- theres a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there.Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free. So Sen. Obama, who has never traveled south of our border, opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. The same country thats helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country thats killing young Americans.And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that weve already paid.Free trade with Colombia is something thats a no-brainer. But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better. Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Sen. Obama doesnt want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.So I dont -- I dont think theres any doubt that Sen. Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes. And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.Were not going to follow that path while Im -- when Im president of the United States. Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans. Theyre seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up. Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country. And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.We need to put health care records online. The V.A. does that. That will -- that will reduce costs. We need to have more community health centers. We need to have walk-in clinics.The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is. We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools. Every parent should know whats going on there.We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit. Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there. Now, Joe, Sen. Obamas plan, if youre a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase, which Sen. Obama wants, if youre out there, my friend, and youve got employees, and youve got kids, if you dont get -- adopt the health care plan that Sen. Obama mandates, hes going to fine you.Now, Sen. Obama, Id like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I dont think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in Americas economy.Sen. Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.If you like that, youll love Canada and England. So the point is... No, you stated it. Excuse me. Zero? Hey, Joe, youre rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that hes been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joes money and then you decide what to do with it.Now, Joe, youre rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where youll have to pay a fine if you dont provide health insurance that Sen. Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.Thats big government at its best.Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.And the good thing about this is theyll be able to go across America. The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $5,800. Im going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability.This will give them availability. This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Sen. Obama and government decide that for them.This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies. If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Sen. Obama wants government to do the job.Sen. Obama wants government to do the job. I want, Joe, you to do the job.I want to leave money in your pocket. I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family. Thats what Im all about. And weve got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years.We cant afford that in the next eight years and Sen. Obama, with the Democrats in charge of Congress, things have gotten worse. Have you noticed, theyve been in charge the last two years. I would never and have never in all the years Ive been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court. Thats not appropriate to do. I thought it was a bad decision. I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad. I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states. Im a federalist. And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up. Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion.We got together seven Republicans, seven Democrats. You were offered a chance to join. You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of, quote, conservative judges.I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg. Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated. This is a very important issue were talking about.Sen. Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they didnt meet his ideological standards. Thats not the way we should judge these nominees. Elections have consequences. They should be judged on their qualifications. And so thats what I will do.I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution. And not legislating from the bench. I would consider anyone in their qualifications. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test. Obviously, that law waved the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years. It was a trial lawyers dream.Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And its got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman whos facing this terribly difficult decision.Sen. Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really -- one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.I dont know how you vote present on some of that. I dont know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And thats his record, and thats a matter of his record.And hell say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Sen. Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America. Just again... Just again, the example of the eloquence of Sen. Obama. Hes health for the mother. You know, thats been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.Thats the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, health. But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. Well do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn. Of course, we have to come together. Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, its vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that well help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and well help take care of it. Well, its the civil rights issue of the 21st century. Theres no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle.But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice?So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements thats already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places, where we have charter schools, where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them.And we find bad teachers another line of work. And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Sen. Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice.Charter schools arent the only answer, but theyre providing competition. They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools.Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer. You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.Look, we must improve education in this country. As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available. We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet. We need to have full student loan program for in-state tuition. And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation. Well, sure. Im sure youre aware, Sen. Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and theres a certain number, I think its a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had. And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.And we all know the state of the Washington, D.C., school system. That was vouchers. That was voucher, Sen. Obama. And Im frankly surprised you didnt pay more attention to that example.Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned, it was a great first beginning in my view. It had its flaws, it had its problems, the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective. And we need to fix a lot of the problems. We need to sit down and reauthorize it.But, again, spending more money isnt always the answer. I think the Head Start program is a great program. A lot of people, including me, said, look, its not doing what it should do. By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program arent any better off than the others.Lets reform it. Lets reform it and fund it. That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats. We need to reform these programs. We need to have transparency. We need to have rewards. Its a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding.And I just said to you earlier, town hall meeting after town hall meeting, parents come with kids, children -- precious children who have autism. Sarah Palin knows about that better than most. And well find and well spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism. And well care for these young children. And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so.But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.And I will support those reforms, and I will fund the ones that are reformed. But Im not going to continue to throw money at a problem. And Ive got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system. And its been proven. Who supports vouchers. She supports vouchers, also. Because theres not enough vouchers; therefore, we shouldnt do it, even though its working. I got it. Well, thank you again, Bob.Thanks to Hofstra.And its great to be with you again. I think weve had a very healthy discussion.My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America. And they were graphically demonstrated again today.America needs a new direction. We cannot be satisfied with what weve been doing for the last eight years.I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it.And Ive been a careful steward of your tax dollars. We have to make health care affordable and available. We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few.We have to stop the spending. We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your childrens futures.All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Sen. Obama and I made (inaudible) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar, to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous, to make sure we reform the institutions of government.Thats why Ive asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country.Ive spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first. As a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace, its been the great honor of my life, and Ive been proud to serve.And I hope youll give me an opportunity to serve again. Id be honored and humbled.\"\"\",\"\"\" Good evening. And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Im Bob Schieffer of CBS News.The rules tonight are simple. The subject is domestic policy. I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.I will ask a question at the beginning of each segment. Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then well have a discussion.Ill encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other. If they do not, I will.The audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain.Gentlemen, welcome.By now, weve heard all the talking points, so lets try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they havent heard. Lets get to it.Another very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know. Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.Sen. McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things.Sen. Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs.I will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?Sen. McCain, you go first. All right. Sen. Obama? All right. Would you like to ask him a question? Is that what you want to do? All right. Lets go to another topic. Its related. So if you have other things you want to say, you can get back to that.This question goes to you first, Sen. Obama.We found out yesterday that this years deficit will reach an astounding record high $455 billion. Some experts say it could go to $1 trillion next year.Both of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit.Arent you both ignoring reality? Wont some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed, postponed, even eliminated?Give us some specifics on what youre going to cut back.Sen. Obama? But youre going to have to cut some of these programs, certainly. Times up.Senator? But what... The question was, what are you going to cut? Which ones? Times up. Times up. Do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years? You have said previously you thought you could, Sen. McCain. You can still do that? In four years? Barack. All right... OK. About 30 seconds. All right. All right. Were going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign. Both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty. Sen. Obama, your campaign has used words like erratic, out of touch, lie, angry, losing his bearings to describe Sen. McCain.Sen. McCain, your commercials have included words like disrespectful, dangerous, dishonorable, he lied. Your running mate said he palled around with terrorists.Are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each others face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?And, Sen. McCain, youre first. Times up. All right. Go ahead. (inaudible) I mean, do you take issue with that? Short answer, yes, short answer. All right. Im going to let you respond and well extend this for a moment. All right. Lets go to the next topic and you -- we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion. I want to ask both of you about the people that youre going to bring into the government.And our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates. So Ill begin by asking both of you this question, and Ill ask you to answer first, Sen. Obama. Why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate? Senator? Do you think shes qualified to be president? Do you think Sen. Biden is qualified? Lets go to -- lets go to a new topic. Were running a little behind.Lets talk about energy and climate control. Every president since Nixon has said what both of you... Climate change, yes -- has said what both of you have said, and, that is, we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil.When Nixon said it, we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil. Now, were importing more than 60 percent.Would each of you give us a number, a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term?And I believe the first question goes to you, Sen. McCain. All right. Can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term, in four years? Senator? All right, lets go to a new topic, health care. Given the current economic situation, would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage? The question is first to Sen. Obama. All right.Sen. McCain? So thats your objective? What about that? All right. A short response. All right. Lets stop there and go to another question. And this one goes to Sen. McCain. Sen. McCain, you believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. Sen. Obama, you believe it shouldnt.Could either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on this issue? Sen. McCain? But you dont want Roe v. Wade to be overturned? But even if it was someone -- even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights, you would consider them? All right. Times up. Response? Lets give Sen. McCain a short response... ... and then... Lets stop there, because I want to get in a question on education and Im afraid this is going to have to be our last question, gentlemen.The question is this: the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education. Yet, by every international measurement, in math and science competence, from kindergarten through the 12th grade, we trail most of the countries of the world.The implications of this are clearly obvious. Some even say it poses a threat to our national security.Do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it?The question to Sen. Obama first. Sen. McCain? Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools? And I mean, more federal money? What about that, Senator? All right. All right.Gentlemen, we have come to the close. Before I ask both of you for your closing statements tonight, Id like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to MyDebates.org, where you will find this evenings debates and the three that preceded tonights debate.Now, for the final statements, by a coin toss, Sen. McCain goes first. Senator? Sen. Obama, Sen. McCain, thank you very much.This concludes the final debate. Im Bob Schieffer of CBS News, and I will leave you tonight with what my mother always said -- go vote now. It will make you feel big and strong. Good night, everyone.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 7 2008,SENATOR OBAMA,SENATOR MCCAIN,\"\"\" Well, Alan, thank you very much for the question. I want to first, obviously, thank Belmont University, Tom, thank you, and to all of you who are participating tonight and those of you who sent e-mail questions in. I think everybody knows now we are in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And a lot of you I think are worried about your jobs, your pensions, your retirement accounts, your ability to send your child or your grandchild to college. And I believe this is a final verdict on the failed economic policies of the last eight years, strongly promoted by President Bush and supported by Senator McCain, that essentially said that we should strip away regulations, consumer protections, let the market run wild, and prosperity would rain down on all of us. It hasnt worked out that way. And so now weve got to take some decisive action.  Now, step one was a rescue package that was passed last week. Weve got to make sure that works properly. And that means strong oversight, making sure that investors, taxpayers are getting their money back and treated as investors. It means that we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that theyre not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. And, in fact, we just found out that AIG, a company that got a bailout, just a week after they got help went on a $400,000 junket. And Ill tell you what, the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired. But thats only step one. The middle-class need a rescue package. And that means tax cuts for the middle-class. It means help for homeowners so that they can stay in their homes. It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs. And then long-term weve got to fix our health care system, weve got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families. You need somebody working for you and youve got to have somebody in Washington who is thinking about the middle class and not just those who can afford to hire lobbyists.  Well, Warren would be a pretty good choice -- Warren Buffett, and Im pleased to have his support. But there are other folks out there. The key is making sure that the next treasury secretary understands that its not enough just to help those at the top. Prosperity is not just going to trickle down. Weve got to help the middle class.  And weve -- you know, Senator McCain and I have some fundamental disagreements on the economy, starting with Senator McCains statement earlier that he thought the fundamentals of the economy were sound. Part of the problem here is that for many of you, wages and incomes have flat-lined. For many of you, it is getting harder and harder to save, harder and harder to retire. And thats why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet. Senator McCain is right that weve got to stabilize housing prices. But underlying that is loss of jobs and loss of income. Thats something that the next treasury secretary is going to have to work on.  Well, Oliver, first, let me tell you whats in the rescue package for you. Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just cant get loans. If they cant get a loan, that means that they cant make payroll. If they cant make payroll, then they may end up having to shut their doors and lay people off. And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country. So it could end up having an adverse effect on everybody, and thats why we had to take action. But we shouldnt have been there in the first place. Now, Ive got to correct a little bit of Senator McCains history, not surprisingly. Lets, first of all, understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system. Senator McCain, as recently as March, bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator. On the other hand, two years ago, I said that weve got a sub-prime lending crisis that has to be dealt with. I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it. A year ago, I went to Wall Street and said weve got to reregulate, and nothing happened.  And Senator McCain during that period said that we should keep on deregulating because thats how the free enterprise system works. Now, with respect to Fannie Mae, what Senator McCain didnt mention is the fact that this bill that he talked about wasnt his own bill. He jumped on it a year after it had been introduced and it never got passed. And I never promoted Fannie Mae. In fact, Senator McCains campaign chairmans firm was a lobbyist on behalf of Fannie Mae, not me. So -- but, look, youre not interested in hearing politicians pointing fingers. What youre interested in is trying to figure out, how is this going to impact you? This is not the end of the process; this is the beginning of the process. And thats why its going to be so important for us to work with homeowners to make sure that they can stay in their homes. The secretary already has the power to do that in the rescue package, but it hasnt been exercised yet. And the next president has to make sure that the next Treasury secretary is thinking about how to strengthen you as a home buyer, you as a homeowner, and not simply think about bailing out banks on Wall Street.  No, I am confident about the American economy. But we are going to have to have some leadership from Washington that not only sets out much better regulations for the financial system. The problem is we still have a archaic, 20th-century regulatory system for 21st-century financial markets. Were going to have to coordinate with other countries to make sure that whatever actions we take work. But most importantly, were going to have to help ordinary families be able to stay in their homes, make sure that they can pay their bills, deal with critical issues like health care and energy, and were going to have to change the culture in Washington so that lobbyists and special interests arent driving the process and your voices arent being drowned out.  Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while youve been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, youve got a family budget. If less money is coming in, you end up making cuts. Maybe you dont go out to dinner as much. Maybe you put off buying a new car. Thats not what happens in Washington. And youre right. There is a lot of blame to go around. But I think its important just to remember a little bit of history. When George Bush came into office, we had surpluses. And now we have half-a-trillion-dollar deficit annually. When George Bush came into office, our debt -- national debt was around $5 trillion. Its now over $10 trillion. Weve almost doubled it. And so while its true that nobodys completely innocent here, we have had over the last eight years the biggest increases in deficit spending and national debt in our history. And Senator McCain voted for four out of five of those George Bush budgets. So heres what I would do. Im going to spend some money on the key issues that weve got to work on.  You know, you may have seen your health care premiums go up. Weve got to reform health care to help you and your budget. We are going to have to deal with energy because we cant keep on borrowing from the Chinese and sending money to Saudi Arabia. We are mortgaging our childrens future. Weve got to have a different energy plan. Weve got to invest in college affordability. So were going to have to make some investments, but weve also got to make spending cuts. And what Ive proposed, youll hear Senator McCain say, well, hes proposing a whole bunch of new spending, but actually Im cutting more than Im spending so that it will be a net spending cut. The key is whether or not weve got priorities that are working for you as opposed to those who have been dictating the policy in Washington lately, and thats mostly lobbyists and special interests. Weve got to put an end to that.  Were going to have to prioritize, just like a family has to prioritize. Now, Ive listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list. Energy we have to deal with today, because youre paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up. And its a strain on your family budget, but its also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices. So weve got to deal with that right away. Thats why Ive called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years. Our goal should be, in 10 years time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil. And we can do it. Now, when JFK said were going to the Moon in 10 years, nobody was sure how to do it, but we understood that, if the American people make a decision to do something, it gets done. So that would be priority number one. Health care is priority number two, because that broken health care system is bad not only for families, but its making our businesses less competitive. And, number three, weve got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy. But just one point I want to make, Tom. Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records. We do need to look at our records. Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot. And thats important. I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that dont work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper. But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going. So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that hes going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, thats money out of the system. And so weve got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that theyre working for you. Thats what Im going to do as president of the United States.  You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country. And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, Go out and shop. That wasnt the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for. And so its important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government. And lets take the example of energy, which we already spoke about. There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy. I believe in the need for increased oil production. Were going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling. It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that theyre not using, that either you use them or you lose them. Were going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy. But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings. And one of the things I want to do is make sure that were providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car thats made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient. And thats going to require effort from each and every one of us. And the last point I just want to make. I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and thats one of the reasons why Im interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America. Thats something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.  Well, I think it starts with Washington. Weve got to show that weve got good habits, because if were running up trillion dollar debts that were passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, Well, you know what? Theres easy money out there. It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this. It means looking at the spending side, but also at the revenue side. I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and thats good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget. Now, when Senator McCain is proposing tax cuts that would give the average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts, thats not sharing a burden. And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they dont feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks. I mean, you know, its tough to ask a teacher whos making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog. And thats why I think its important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze. Thats an example of an unfair burden sharing. Thats using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.  I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who dont need help, arent getting it. Thats how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.  Tom, can I respond to this briefly? Because...  The tax issue, because I think its very important. Go ahead.  Well, Tom, were going to have to take on entitlements and I think weve got to do it quickly. Were going to have a lot of work to do, so I cant guarantee that were going to do it in the next two years, but Id like to do in the my first term as president. But I think its important to understand, were not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies. And you know, Senator McCain, I think the Straight Talk Express lost a wheel on that one. So lets be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCains, because were not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in. I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up. If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down. Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses. Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 a year. So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan. And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just cant afford it. Some small business owners, a lot of them, cant even afford health insurance for themselves. Now, in contrast, Senator McCain wants to give a $300 billion tax cut, $200 billion of it to the largest corporations and a hundred thousand of it -- a hundred billion of it going to people like CEOs on Wall Street. He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts. That is not fair. And it doesnt work.  Now, if we get our tax policies right so that theyre good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.  This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.  And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, its an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. And we can do it, but were going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, weve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well. And thats why weve got to make some investments and Ive called for investments in solar, wind, geothermal. Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix. But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record. Senator McCain and I actually agree on something. He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington havent done anything. What Senator McCain doesnt mention is hes been there 26 of them. And during that time, he voted 23 times against alternative fuels, 23 times. So its easy to talk about this stuff during a campaign, but its important for us to understand that it requires a sustained effort from the next president. One last point I want to make on energy. Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and thats important, but we have three percent of the worlds oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil. So what that means is that we cant simply drill our way out of the problem. And were not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming. Were going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week. Weve got to make sure that were giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.  Im just trying to keep up with John.  Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care. It is breaking family budgets. I cant tell you how many people I meet who dont have health insurance. If youve got health insurance, most of you have seen your premiums double over the last eight years. And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone. If youre a small business, its a crushing burden. So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing. So heres what I would do. If youve got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it. You can keep your choice of doctor. Were going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year. And were going to do it by investing in prevention. Were going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital. That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs. If you dont have health insurance, youre going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees. Because theres a huge pool, we can drop the costs. And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem. Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach. He says that hes going to give you a $5,000 tax credit. What he doesnt tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever. So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away. He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure youre not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered. And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go. In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system. That, I dont think, is the kind of change that we need. Weve got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care. And thats something that Im committed to doing as president.  Well, why dont -- why dont -- lets talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.  Well, I think it should be a right for every American. In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they cant pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because theyre saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they dont have to pay her treatment, theres something fundamentally wrong about that. So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference. And, Tom, I know that were under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there. Number one, let me just repeat, if youve got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it. All Im going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it. Youll still have choice of doctor. Theres no mandate involved. Small businesses are not going to have a mandate. What were going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need. Now, its true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we dont want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma. And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesnt mention is he voted against the expansion of the Childrens Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didnt have previously health insurance have it now. Now, the final point Ill make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that dont give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that youre paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, youre not getting it. And the reason that its a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do? They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there. Thats how in banking it works. Everybody goes to Delaware, because theyve got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards. And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, youre not going to have available to you. That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain. He believes in deregulation in every circumstance. Thats what weve been going through for the last eight years. It hasnt worked, and we need fundamental change.  Well, you know, Senator McCain, in the last debate and today, again, suggested that I dont understand. Its true. There are some things I dont understand. I dont understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us. That was Senator McCains judgment and it was the wrong judgment. When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, wed be greeted as liberators. That was the wrong judgment, and its been costly to us. So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude. But its also put an enormous strain on our budget. Weve spent, so far, close to $700 billion and if we continue on the path that were on, as Senator McCain is suggesting, its going to go well over $1 trillion. Were spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion. And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for. Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth. We are a force of good in the world. But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority. And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect thats been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we dont have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing. Thats going to change when Im president, but we cant change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCains and George Bushs foreign policy. It has not worked for America.  Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake. If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in? If we couldve stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act. So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.  And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible. But understand that theres a lot of cruelty around the world. Were not going to be able to be everywhere all the time. Thats why its so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies. Lets take the example of Darfur just for a moment. Right now theres a peacekeeping force that has been set up and we have African Union troops in Darfur to stop a genocide that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead. And thats what I intend to do when Im president.  Katie, its a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan. I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadnt finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda. So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there. They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation. Theyre stronger now than at any time since 2001. And thats why I think its so important for us to reverse course, because thats the central front on terrorism. They are plotting to kill Americans right now. As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and thats where it will end. So part of the reason I think its so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking thats funding terrorism. But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan. We cant coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then hes making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.  What Ive said is were going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants. And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act and we will take them out. We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority.  Tom, just a...  ... just a quick follow-up on this. I think...  Then lets have one.  Just -- just -- just a quick follow-up, because I think -- I think this is important.  Youre doing a great job, Tom. Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said. Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan. Senator McCain continues to repeat this. What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should. Now, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans. Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, Im green behind the ears and, you know, Im just spouting off, and hes somber and responsible.  Senator McCain, this is the guy who sang, Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran, who called for the annihilation of North Korea. That I dont think is an example of speaking softly. This is the person who, after we had -- we hadnt even finished Afghanistan, where he said, Next up, Baghdad. So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly. And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties. We were not promoting democracy. This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when Im president.  Ill be very brief. We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because were going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan. General McKiernan, the commander in Afghanistan right now, is desperate for more help, because our bases and outposts are now targets for more aggressive Afghan -- Taliban offenses. Were also going to have to work with the Karzai government, and when I met with President Karzai, I was very clear that, You are going to have to do better by your people in order for us to gain the popular support thats necessary. I dont think he has to be a dictator. And we want a democracy in Afghanistan. But we have to have a government that is responsive to the Afghan people, and, frankly, its just not responsive right now.  Well, the resurgence of Russia is one of the central issues that were going to have to deal with in the next presidency. And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken. But we cant just provide moral support. Weve got to provide moral support to the Poles and Estonia and Latvia and all of the nations that were former Soviet satellites. But weve also got to provide them with financial and concrete assistance to help rebuild their economies. Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges. And some say that thats what Putin intended in the first place. The other thing we have to do, though, is weve got to see around the corners. Weve got to anticipate some of these problems ahead of time. You know, back in April, I put out a statement saying that the situation in Georgia was unsustainable because you had Russian peacekeepers in these territories that were under dispute. And you knew that if the Russians themselves were trying to obtain some of these territories or push back against Georgia, that that was not a stable situation. So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen. We havent been doing enough of that. We tend to be reactive. Thats what weve been doing over the last eight years and that has actually made us more safe. Thats part of what happened in Afghanistan, where we rushed into Iraq and Senator McCain and President Bush suggested that it wasnt that important to catch bin Laden right now and that we could muddle through, and that has cost us dearly. Weve got to be much more strategic if were going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there. And one last point I want to make about Russia. Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia. If we can reduce our energy consumption, that reduces the amount of petro dollars that they have to make mischief around the world. That will strengthen us and weaken them when it comes to issues like Georgia.  I think theyve engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand theyre not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.  Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and were grateful for it. We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. It would be a game-changer in the region. Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. And so its unacceptable. And I will do everything thats required to prevent it. And we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we dont provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where weve got to make those kinds of choices. And thats why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though its an oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you dont change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re-join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But one of the things weve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether its in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. When President Bush decided were not going to talk to Iran, were not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4,000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. Weve got to try to have talks, understanding that were not taking military options off the table.  My wife, Michelle, is there and she could give you a much longer list than I do. And most of the time, I learn it by asking her. But, look, the nature of the challenges that were going to face are immense and one of the things that we know about the presidency is that its never the challenges that you expect. Its the challenges that you dont that end up consuming most of your time. But heres what I do know. I know that I wouldnt be standing here if it werent for the fact that this country gave me opportunity. I came from very modest means. I had a single mom and my grandparents raised me and it was because of the help of scholarships and my grandmother scrimping on things that she might have wanted to purchase and my mom, at one point, getting food stamps in order for us to put food on the table. Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country. The same is true for Michelle and Im sure the same is true for a lot of you. And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation? Over the last eight years, weve seen that dream diminish. Wages and incomes have gone down. People have lost their health care or are going bankrupt because they get sick. Weve got young people who have got the grades and the will and the drive to go to college, but they just dont have the money. And we cant expect that if we do the same things that weve been doing over the last eight years, that somehow we are going to have a different outcome. We need fundamental change. Thats whats at stake in this election. Thats the reason I decided to run for president, and Im hopeful that all of you are prepared to continue this extraordinary journey that we call America. But were going to have to have the courage and the sacrifice, the nerve to move in a new direction. Thank you. BROKAW: Senator McCain, you get the last word. Senator Obama had the opening. Youre last up. \"\"\",\"\"\" Well, thank you, Tom. Thank you, Belmont University. And Senator Obama, its good to be with you at a town hall meeting. And, Alan, thank you for your question. You go to the heart of Americas worries tonight. Americans are angry, theyre upset, and theyre a little fearful. Its our job to fix the problem. Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence. Weve got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that dont want us very -- like us very much. We have to keep Americans taxes low. All Americans taxes low. Lets not raise taxes on anybody today. We obviously have to stop this spending spree thats going on in Washington. Do you know that weve laid a $10 trillion debt on these young Americans who are here with us tonight, $500 billion of it we owe to China? Weve got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world. And I think that this problem has become so severe, as you know, that were going to have to do something about home values. You know that home values of retirees continues to decline and people are no longer able to afford their mortgage payments. As president of the United States, Alan, I would order the secretary of the treasury to immediately buy up the bad home loan mortgages in America and renegotiate at the new value of those homes -- at the diminished value of those homes and let people be able to make those -- be able to make those payments and stay in their homes. Is it expensive? Yes. But we all know, my friends, until we stabilize home values in America, were never going to start turning around and creating jobs and fixing our economy. And weve got to give some trust and confidence back to America. I know how the do that, my friends. And its my proposal, its not Senator Obamas proposal, its not President Bushs proposal. But I know how to get America working again, restore our economy and take care of working Americans. Thank you.  Not you, Tom. (LAUGHTER)  You know, thats a tough question and theres a lot of qualified Americans. But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual. A supporter of Senator Obamas is Warren Buffett. He has already weighed in and helped stabilize some of the difficulties in the markets and with companies and corporations, institutions today. I like Meg Whitman, she knows what its like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now 1.3 million people in America make their living off eBay. Maybe somebody here has done a little business with them. But the point is its going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence. Because the problem in America today to a large extent, Tom, is that we dont have trust and confidence in our institutions because of the corruption on Wall Street and the greed and excess and the cronyism in Washington, D.C.  Well, thank you, Oliver, and thats an excellent question, because as you just described it, bailout, when I believe that its rescue, because -- because of the greed and excess in Washington and Wall Street, Main Street was paying a very heavy price, and we know that. I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures. But you know, one of the real catalysts, really the match that lit this fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Ill bet you, you may never even have heard of them before this crisis. But you know, theyre the ones that, with the encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies and his friends in Washington, that went out and made all these risky loans, gave them to people that could never afford to pay back. And you know, there were some of us that stood up two years ago and said weve got to enact legislation to fix this. Weve got to stop this greed and excess. Meanwhile, the Democrats in the Senate and some -- and some members of Congress defended what Fannie and Freddie were doing. They resisted any change. Meanwhile, they were getting all kinds of money in campaign contributions. Senator Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money in history -- in history. So this rescue package means that we will stabilize markets, we will shore up these institutions. But its not enough. Thats why were going to have to go out into the housing market and were going to have to buy up these bad loans and were going to have to stabilize home values, and that way, Americans, like Alan, can realize the American dream and stay in their home. But Fannie and Freddie were the catalysts, the match that started this forest fire. There were some of us -- there were some of us that stood up against it. There were others who took a hike.  I think it depends on what we do. I think if we act effectively, if we stabilize the housing market -- which I believe we can, if we go out and buy up these bad loans, so that people can have a new mortgage at the new value of their home -- I think if we get rid of the cronyism and special interest influence in Washington so we can act more effectively. My friend, Id like you to see the letter that a group of senators and I wrote warning exactly of this crisis. Senator Obamas name was not on that letter. The point is -- the point is that we can fix our economy. Americans workers are the best in the world. Theyre the fundamental aspect of Americas economy. Theyre the most innovative. Theyre the best -- theyre most -- have best -- were the best exporters. Were the best importers. Theyre most effective. They are the best workers in the world. And weve got to give them a chance. Theyve got -- weve got to give them a chance to do their best again. And they are the innocent bystanders here in what is the biggest financial crisis and challenge of our time. We can do it.  Well, Theresa, thank you. And I can see why you feel that cynicism and mistrust, because the system in Washington is broken. And I have been a consistent reformer. I have advocated and taken on the special interests, whether they be the big money people by reaching across the aisle and working with Senator Feingold on campaign finance reform, whether it being a variety of other issues, working with Senator Lieberman on trying to address climate change. I have a clear record of bipartisanship. The situation today cries out for bipartisanship. Senator Obama has never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue. And we need to reform. And so lets look at our records as well as our rhetoric. Thats really part of your mistrust here. And now I suggest that maybe you go to some of these organizations that are the watchdogs of what we do, like the Citizens Against Government Waste or the National Taxpayers Union or these other organizations that watch us all the time. I dont expect you to watch every vote. And you know what youll find? This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate. I have fought against excessive spending and outrages. I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them. Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now? New spending. Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks? He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois. My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money? I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his. Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again. Youre going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them. And drilling offshore and nuclear power are two vital elements of that. And Ive been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.  The three priorities were health...  I think you can work on all three at once, Tom. I think its very important that reform our entitlement programs. My friends, we are not going to be able to provide the same benefit for present-day workers that we are going -- that present-day retirees have today. Were going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip ONeill. I know how to do that. I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others. Thats my clear record. We can work on nuclear power plants. Build a whole bunch of them, create millions of new jobs. We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology. All of these things we can do as Americans and we can take on this mission and we can overcome it.  My friends, some of this $700 billion ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. As far as health care is concerned, obviously, everyone is struggling to make sure that they can afford their premiums and that they can have affordable and available health care. Thats the next issue. But we can do them all at once. Theres no -- and we have to do them all at once. All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.  Well, Fiora, Im going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate. I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government. And were going to have to eliminate those that arent working. I know a lot of them that arent working. One of them is in defense spending, because Ive taken on some of the defense contractors. I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion. I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks. And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well. And theyll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others. So were going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America. And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, well just have to have across-the-board freeze. And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we dont even -- sometimes we dont even know about until months later. And, by the way, I want to go back a second.  Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time. Were not -- were not -- were not rifle shots here. We are Americans. We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together. Frankly, Im not going to tell that person without health insurance that, Im sorry, youll have to wait. Im going to tell you Americans well get to work right away and well get to work together, and we can get them all done, because thats what America has been doing.  Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obamas various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one. But he wants to raise taxes. My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which Im sure well get to at some point. You know, last year up to this time, weve lost 700,000 jobs in America. The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses. Senator Obamas secret that you dont know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue. Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and wont be able to hire because of Senator Obamas tax policies. You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad. Ive got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad. So lets not raise anybodys taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000. To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obamas plan calls for. And lets create jobs and lets get our economy going again. And lets not raise anybodys taxes.  Sure. Hey, Ill answer the question. Look -- look, its not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom. Its just...  ... tough decisions. I want to get to Medicare in a second. Social Security is not that tough. We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are. Weve got to sit down together across the table. Its been done before. I saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip ONeill from Massachusetts. Thats what we need more of, and thats what Ive done in Washington. Senator Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue. Ive taken them on. Im not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his. So Medicare, its going to be a little tougher. Its going to be a little tougher because were talking about very complex and difficult issues. My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down. Lets not let them fool with it anymore. Theres too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there. So lets have -- and lets have the American people say, Fix it for us. Now, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, its back to our first question here about rhetoric and record. Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. Thats his record. When he ran for the United States Senate from Illinois, he said he would have a middle-income tax cut. You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that? So lets look at our record. Ive fought higher taxes. I have fought excess spending. I have fought to reform government. Lets look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America. And well get our economy going again. And our best days are ahead of us.  Well, thank you. Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that. And lets keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today. But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue. I traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, Joe Lieberman and I. And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it. Thats the good news, my friends. The bad news is we lost. But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes. Now, how -- whats -- whats the best way of fixing it? Nuclear power. Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that. Look, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is safe, and its clean, and it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs. And -- and I know that we can reprocess the spent nuclear fuel. The Japanese, the British, the French do it. And we can do it, too. Senator Obama has opposed that. We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs. We can do that, we as Americans, because were the best innovators, were the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.  Tom, wave like that and Ill look at you.  Sure.  I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate. I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector. By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth. It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney. You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one. You know who voted against it? Me. I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes. I vote against them, my friends. I vote against them. But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap. We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know theres a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down. Thats fundamental economics. Weve got to drill offshore, my friends, and weve got to do it now, and we can do it. And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record. Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. And Ill stop, Tom, and you didnt even wave. Thanks.  Well, thank you for the question. You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces. Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America. And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient. Lets put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them. Lets have community health centers. Lets have walk-in clinics. Lets do a lot of things to impose efficiencies. But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. As you notice, he starts talking about government. He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and hell impose mandates. If youre a small business person and you dont insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you. Will fine you. Thats remarkable. If youre a parent and youre struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you. I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit. They can take it anywhere, across state lines. Why not? Dont we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America? Of course its OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee. And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have whats left over and you add $5,000 that youre going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies. You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself. But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability. Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could. Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance. Of course they all want to do that. Weve got to give them the wherewithal to do it. We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.  I think its a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member. And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that. But government mandates I -- Im always a little nervous about. But it is certainly my responsibility. It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility. American citizens understand that. Employers understand that. But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you dont get the health care policy that I think you should have, then youre going to get fined. And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be. Perhaps we might find that out tonight.  I dont believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?  Well, I thank you for that question, because theres no doubt that history shows us that nations that are strong militarily over time have to have a strong economy, as well. And that is one of the challenges that America faces. But having said that, America -- and well hear a lot of criticism. Ive heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified. But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world. My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody elses freedom and our own.  So we are peacemakers and were peacekeepers. But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure. And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but weve done because were a nation of good. And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that Im -- a record that Im willing to stand on. Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge. He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia. And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges. We dont have time for on-the-job training, my friends.  Well, let me just follow up, my friends. If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base. There was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. Ill bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are. We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldnt. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed. So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize youre sending Americas most precious asset, American blood, into harms way. And, again, I know those situations. Ive been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nations security. And I may have to make those tough decisions. But I wont take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we dont leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.  Well, Katie, thank you. You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick. Senator Obama likes to talk loudly. In fact, he said he wants to announce that hes going to attack Pakistan. Remarkable. You know, if you are a country and youre trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion. When you announce that youre going to launch an attack into another country, its pretty obvious that you have the effect that it had in Pakistan: It turns public opinion against us. Now, let me just go back with you very briefly. We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake. We washed our hands of Afghanistan. The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war. Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support. Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq. And that is to get the support of the people. We need to help the Pakistani government go into Waziristan, where I visited, a very rough country, and -- and get the support of the people, and get them to work with us and turn against the cruel Taliban and others. And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick.  If were going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.  Itd be fine with me. Itd be fine with me.  Itd be fine with me.  Thank you very much.  And, Tom, if -- if were going to go back and forth, I then -- Id like to have equal time to go -- to respond to...  ... to -- to -- to...  Not true. Not true. I have, obviously, supported those efforts that the United States had to go in militarily and I have opposed that I didnt think so. I understand what its like to send young Americans in harms way. I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this. I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran. But the point is that I know how to handle these crises. And Senator Obama, by saying that he would attack Pakistan, look at the context of his words. Ill get Osama bin Laden, my friends. Ill get him. I know how to get him. Ill get him no matter what and I know how to do it. But Im not going to telegraph my punches, which is what Senator Obama did. And Im going to act responsibly, as I have acted responsibly throughout my military career and throughout my career in the United States Senate. And we have fundamental disagreements about the use of military power and how you do it, and you just saw it in response to previous questions.  General Petraeus has just taken over a position of responsibility, where he has the command and will really set the tone for the strategy and tactics that are used. And Ive had conversations with him. It is the same overall strategy. Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is correct on. We have to double the size of the Afghan army. We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure. We have to do a lot of things. We have to work much more closely with the Pakistanis. But most importantly, we have to have the same strategy, which Senator Obama said wouldnt work, couldnt work, still fails to admit that he was wrong about Iraq. He still will not admit that he was wrong about the strategy of the surge in Iraq, and thats the same kind of strategy of go out and secure and hold and allow people to live normal lives. And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing thats happening in Iraq today. So I have confidence that General Petraeus, working with the Pakistanis, working with the Afghans, doing the same job that he did in Iraq, will again. We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.  First of all, as I say, I dont think that -- were not going to have another Cold War with Russia. But have no doubt that Russias behavior is certainly outside the norms of behavior that we would expect for nations which are very wealthy, as Russia has become, because of their petro dollars. Now, long ago, I warned about Vladimir Putin. I said I looked into his eyes and saw three letters, a K, a G and a B. He has surrounded himself with former KGB apparatchiks. He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia. I said before, watch Ukraine. Ukraine, right now, is in the sights of Vladimir Putin, those that want to reassemble the old Soviet Union. Weve got to show moral support for Georgia.  Weve got to show moral support for Ukraine. Weve got to advocate for their membership in NATO. We have to make the Russians understand that there are penalties for these this kind of behavior, this kind of naked aggression into Georgia, a tiny country and a tiny democracy. And so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior. Now, the G-8 is one of those, but there are many others. But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors.  It will not be a re-ignition of the Cold War, but Russia is a challenge.  Maybe. (LAUGHTER)  Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things. If I say yes, then that means that were reigniting the old Cold War. If I say no, it ignores their behavior. Obviously energy is going to be a big, big factor. And Georgia and Ukraine are both major gateways of energy into Europe. And thats one of the reasons why its in our interest. But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but theyve got to understand that theyre facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world.  Well, thank you, Terry. And thank you for your service to the country. I want to say, everything I ever learned about leadership I learned from a chief petty officer. And I thank you, and I thank you, my friend. Thanks for serving. Let -- let -- let me say that we obviously would not wait for the United Nations Security Council. I think the realities are that both Russia and China would probably pose significant obstacles. And our challenge right now is the Iranians continue on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons, and its a great threat. Its not just a threat -- threat to the state of Israel. Its a threat to the stability of the entire Middle East. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, all the other countries will acquire them, too. The tensions will be ratcheted up. What would you do if you were the Israelis and the president of a country says that they are -- they are determined to wipe you off the map, calls your country a stinking corpse? Now, Senator Obama without precondition wants to sit down and negotiate with them, without preconditions. Thats what he stated, again, a matter of record. I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior. And I think we can do that. I think, joining with our allies and friends in a league of democracies, that we can effectively abridge their behavior, and hopefully they would abandon this quest that they are on for nuclear weapons. But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what its like to serve, and you know what its like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place.  Well, thank you, Tom. And I think what I dont know is what all of us dont know, and thats whats going to happen both here at home and abroad. The challenges that we face are unprecedented. Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation. There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans. So what I dont know is what the unexpected will be. But I have spent my whole life serving this country. I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our countrys business. My mother basically raised our family. I know what its like in dark times. I know what its like to have to fight to keep ones hope going through difficult times. I know what its like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times. I know what its like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight. Thats what Americas all about. I believe in this country. I believe in its future. I believe in its greatness. Its been my great honor to serve it for many, many years. And Im asking the American people to give me another opportunity and Ill rest on my record, but Ill also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first. Thank you, Tom. \"\"\",\"\"\" Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. Im Tom Brokaw of NBC News. And welcome to this second presidential debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights debate is the only one with a town hall format. The Gallup Organization chose 80 uncommitted voters from the Nashville area to be here with us tonight. And earlier today, each of them gave me a copy of their question for the candidates. From all of these questions -- and from tens of thousands submitted online -- I have selected a long list of excellent questions on domestic and foreign policy. Neither the commission nor the candidates have seen the questions. And although we wont be able to get to all of them tonight, we should have a wide-ranging discussion one month before the election. Each candidate will have two minutes to respond to a common question, and there will be a one-minute follow-up. The audience here in the hall has agreed to be polite, and attentive, no cheering or outbursts. Those of you at home, of course, are not so constrained. The only exception in the hall is right now, as it is my privilege to introduce the candidates, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and Senator John McCain of Arizona. Gentlemen? (APPLAUSE) Gentlemen, we want to get underway immediately, if we can. Since you last met at Ole Miss 12 days ago, the world has changed a great deal, and not for the better. We still dont know where the bottom is at this time. As you might expect, many of the questions that we have from here in the hall tonight and from online have to do with the American economy and, in fact, with global economic conditions. I understand that you flipped a coin. And, Senator Obama, you will begin tonight. And were going to have our first question from over here in Section A from Alan Schaefer. Alan?   Senator McCain?  Senator, we have one minute for a discussion here. Obviously the powers of the treasury secretary have been greatly expanded. The most powerful officer in the cabinet now. Hank Paulson says he wont stay on. Who do you have in mind to appoint to that very important post? Senator McCain?  No, with good reason.  All right. Senator McCain -- Senator Obama, who do you have in mind for treasury secretary?  Senator Obama, thank you very much. May I remind both of you, if I can, that were operating under rules that you signed off on and when we have a discussion, it really is to be confined within about a minute or so. Were going to go now, Senator McCain, to the next question from you from the hall here, and it comes from Oliver Clark, who is over here in section F. Oliver?  Senator Obama?  Senator Obama, time for a discussion. Im going to begin with you. Are you saying to Mr. Clark and to the other members of the American television audience that the American economy is going to get much worse before it gets better and they ought to be prepared for that?  Senator McCain, in all candor, do you think the economy is going to get worse before it gets better?  Thank you, Senator McCain. Were going to continue over in Section F, as it turns out. Senator Obama, this is a question from you from Theresa Finch. Theresa?  Senator McCain?  Weve run out of time. We have this one-minute discussion period going on here. There are new economic realities out there that everyone in this hall and across this country understands that there are going to have to be some choices made. Health policies, energy policies, and entitlement reform, what are going to be your priorities in what order? Which of those will be your highest priority your first year in office and which will follow in sequence? Senator McCain?  The three -- health care, energy, and entitlement reform: Social Security and Medicare. In what order would you put them in terms of priorities?  Im trying to play by the rules that you all established. One minute for discussion. Senator Obama, if you would give us your list of priorities, there are some real questions about whether everything can be done at once.  All right, gentlemen, I want to just remind you one more time about time. Were going to have a larger deficit than the federal government does if we dont get this under control here before too long. (LAUGHTER) Senator McCain, for you, we have our first question from the Internet tonight. A child of the Depression, 78-year-old Fiora from Chicago. Since World War II, we have never been asked to sacrifice anything to help our country, except the blood of our heroic men and women. As president, what sacrifices -- sacrifices will you ask every American to make to help restore the American dream and to get out of the economic morass that were now in?  Senator McCain, thank you very much. Senator Obama?  Senator Obama, as we begin, very quickly, our discussion period, President Bush, youll remember, last summer, said that Wall Street got drunk. A lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk and, in fact, the American consumers got drunk. How would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too much easy credit, specifically, across the board, for this country, not just at the federal level, but as a model for the rest of the country, as well?  Senator McCain?  Senator Obama, we have another question from the Internet.  Well, look, guys, the rules were established by the two campaigns, we worked very hard on this. This will address, I think, the next question.  There are lots of issues that we are going to be dealing with here tonight. And we have a question from Langdon in Ballston Spa, New York, and thats about huge unfunded obligations for Social Security, Medicare, and other entitlement programs that will soon eat up all of the revenue thats in place and then go into a deficit position. Since the rules are pretty loose here, Im going to add my own to this one. Instead of having a discussion, let me ask you as a coda to that. Would you give Congress a date certain to reform Social Security and Medicare within two years after you take office? Because in a bipartisan way, everyone agrees, thats a big ticking time bomb that will eat us up maybe even more than the mortgage crisis.  Senator McCain, two years for a reform of entitlement programs?  And Medicare.  Senator McCain, thank you very much. Im going to stick by my part of the pact and not ask a follow-up here. The next question does come from the hall for Senator McCain. It comes from Section C over here, and its from Ingrid Jackson. Ingrid?  Senator Obama?  Gentlemen, you may not have noticed, but we have lights around here. They have red and green and yellow and they are to signal...  All right, Senator. Heres a follow-up to that, one-minute discussion. Its a simple question.  Should we fund a Manhattan-like project that develops a nuclear bomb to deal with global energy and alternative energy or should we fund 100,000 garages across America, the kind of industry and innovation that developed Silicon Valley?  Thank you very much, Senator. Next question for you, Senator Obama, and it comes from the E section over here and its from Lindsey Trellow. Lindsey? Do you believe health care should be treated as a commodity?  Senator McCain?  Quick discussion. Is health care in America a privilege, a right, or a responsibility? Senator McCain?  Privilege, right or responsibility. Lets start with that.  Senator, we want to move on now. If wed come back to the hall here, were going to shift gears here a little bit and were going to go to foreign policy and international matters, if we can...  Phil Elliott is over here in this section, and Phil Elliott has a question for Senator McCain. Phil?  Senator Obama, the economic constraints on the U.S. military action around the world.  Senator Obama, let me ask you if -- lets see if we can establish tonight the Obama doctrine and the McCain doctrine for the use of United States combat forces in situations where theres a humanitarian crisis, but it does not affect our national security. Take the Congo, where 4.5 million people have died since 1998, or take Rwanda in the earlier dreadful days, or Somalia. What is the Obama doctrine for use of force that the United States would send when we dont have national security issues at stake?  Senator McCain, the McCain Doctrine, if you will.  Senator McCain, thank you very much. Next question for Senator Obama, it comes from the F section and is from Katie Hamm. Katie?  Senator McCain?  Senator McCain...  No, I know. So but I think we get at it...  ... if I can, with this question.  All right, lets have a follow-up.  Im just the hired help here, so, I mean... (LAUGHTER)  Yes, you get the...  ... last word here, and then we have to move on.  Can I get a quick response from the two of you about developments in Afghanistan this week? The senior British military commander, who is now leading there for a second tour, and their senior diplomatic presence there, Sherard Cowper-Coles, who is well known as an expert in the area, both have said that were failing in Afghanistan. The commander said we cannot win there. Weve got to get it down to a low level insurgency, let the Afghans take it over. Cowper-Coles said what we need is an acceptable dictator. If either of you becomes president, as one of you will, how do you reorganize Afghanistans strategy or do you? Briefly, if you can.  Senator McCain, briefly.  Senator McCain, this question is for you from the Internet. Its from Alden in Hewitt, Texas. How can we apply pressure to Russia for humanitarian issues in an effective manner without starting another Cold War?  Senator Obama.  Senator Obama? Were winding down, so if we can keep track of the time.  This requires only a yes or a no. Ronald Reagan famously said that the Soviet Union was the evil empire. Do you think that Russia under Vladimir Putin is an evil empire?  Senator McCain?  Maybe.  All right. Were going to try to get in two more questions, if we can. So we have to move along. Over in section A, Terry Chary -- do I have that right, Terry? QUESTION: Senator, as a retired Navy chief, my thoughts are often with those who serve our country. I know both candidates, both of you, expressed support for Israel.  Senator Obama?  All right, gentlemen, weve come to the last question. And youll both be interested to know this comes from the Internet and its from a state that youre strongly contesting, both of you. Its from Peggy in Amherst, New Hampshire. And it has a certain Zen-like quality, Ill give you a fair warning. She says, What dont you know and how will you learn it? (LAUGHTER) Senator Obama, you get first crack at that.  Thank you very much, Senator McCain. That concludes tonights debate from here in Nashville. We want to thank our hosts here at Belmont University in Nashville and the Commission on Presidential Debates. And youre in my way of my script there, if you will move. (APPLAUSE) In addition to everything else, there is one more presidential debate on Wednesday, October 15, at Hofstra University in New York, moderated by my friend, Bob Schieffer of CBS News. Thank you, Senator McCain. Thank you, Senator Obama. Good night, everyone, from Nashville.\"\"\"\n",
      "September 26 2008,SENATOR OBAMA,SENATOR MCCAIN,\"\"\": Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight. I cant think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.And although weve heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy.And youre wondering, hows it going to affect me? Hows it going to affect my job? Hows it going to affect my house? Hows it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college? So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely. And Ive put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.No. 1, weve got to make sure that weve got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money.No. 2, weve got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.No. 3, weve got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.And, No. 4, weve got to make sure that were helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country. Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.It hasnt worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. Thats why Im running for president, and thats what I hope were going to be talking about tonight.: We havent seen the language yet. And I do think that theres constructive work being done out there. So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time.Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it.So -- so the question, I think, that weve got to ask ourselves is, yes, weve got to solve this problem short term. And we are going to have to intervene; theres no doubt about that.But were also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations? We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems. And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.: Well, I think Senator McCains absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when theres a crisis. I mean, weve had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been whats good for Wall Street, but not whats good for Main Street.And there are folks out there whove been struggling before this crisis took place. And thats why its so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.: I do not think that they are.: Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. And...: The -- and I just fundamentally disagree. And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when theres a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, theyve got a little financial crisis going on.Theyre having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments. We havent been paying attention to them. And if you look at our tax policies, its a classic example.: Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.And hes also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasnt the case with me.But lets be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last years budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.So my attitude is, weve got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What Ive called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.And that means that the ordinary American out there whos collecting a paycheck every day, theyve got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.: I -- I dont know where John is getting his figures. Lets just be clear.What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that were giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it.But lets go back to the original point. John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important. And, absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when Im president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.: And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we cant afford another four.: Well, let me just make a couple of points.: My definition -- heres what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase.Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right. Heres the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.Its not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And thats a problem.Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit. Now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit. Heres the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.It is not a good deal for the American people. But its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be.: John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion.: Thats not true, John. Thats not true.: Look, its just not true. And if we want to talk about oil company profits, under your tax plan, John -- this is undeniable -- oil companies would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.Now, look, we all would love to lower taxes on everybody. But heres the problem: If we are giving them to oil companies, then that means that there are those who are not going to be getting them. And...: No, but, John, the fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out. Weve got an emergency bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but youre opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.: Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed. We dont yet know what our tax revenues are going to be. The economy is slowing down, so its hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.But theres no doubt that were not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done. There are some things that I think have to be done.We have to have energy independence, so Ive put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that were developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.We have to fix our health care system, which is putting an enormous burden on families. Just -- a report just came out that the average deductible went up 30 percent on American families.They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care. Im meeting folks all over the country. We have to do that now, because it will actually make our businesses and our families better off.The third thing we have to do is weve got to make sure that were competing in education. Weve got to invest in science and technology. China had a space launch and a space walk. Weve got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.And I also think that were going to have to rebuild our infrastructure, which is falling behind, our roads, our bridges, but also broadband lines that reach into rural communities.Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.So there are some -- some things that weve got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy. We cant shortchange those things. Weve got to eliminate programs that dont work, and weve got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.: No. As I said before, Jim, there are going to be things that end up having to be ...: ... deferred and delayed. Well, look, I want to make sure that we are investing in energy in order to free ourselves from the dependence on foreign oil. That is a big project. That is a multi-year project.: Not willing to give up the need to do it but there may be individual components that we cant do. But John is right we have to make cuts. We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesnt work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works.They did it on the Medicaid prescription drug bill and we have to change the culture. Tom -- or John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly thats just me opposing George Bushs wrong headed policies since Ive been in Congress but I think it is that it is also important to recognize I work with Tom Coburn, the most conservative, one of the most conservative Republicans who John already mentioned to set up what we call a Google for government saying well list every dollar of federal spending to make sure that the taxpayer can take a look and see who, in fact, is promoting some of these spending projects that Johns been railing about.: The problem with a spending freeze is youre using a hatchet where you need a scalpel. There are some programs that are very important that are under funded. I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy doesnt make sense.Let me tell you another place to look for some savings. We are currently spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when they have a $79 billion surplus. It seems to me that if were going to be strong at home as well as strong abroad, that we have to look at bringing that war to a close.: Theres no doubt it will affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it. Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, we holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If were lucky and do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.And because of the economys slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president Im go doing have to make some tough decision.The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make the tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and our priorities and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities.: I just want to make this point, Jim. John, its been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending. This orgy of spending and enormous deficits you voted for almost all of his budgets. So to stand here and after eight years and say that youre going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasnt happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow.: Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because I think the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.Now six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war at a time when it was politically risky to do so because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world, and whether our intelligence was sound, but also because we hadnt finished the job in Afghanistan.We hadnt caught bin Laden. We hadnt put al Qaeda to rest, and as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction. Now Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment.And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but thats not the case. Weve spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.We took our eye off the ball. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not, as president, in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely. And we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.: Which point? He raised a whole bunch of them.: Look, Im very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and as he explains, and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, dont go through my subcommittee because theyre done as a committee as a whole.But thats Senate inside baseball. But lets get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families.They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job. But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.And so John likes -- John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003, and at the time when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shiite and Sunni. And you were wrong. And so my question is...: ... of judgment, of whether or not -- of whether or not -- if the question is who is best-equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.: Thats not true.: Thats not true.: Jim, Jim, this is a big...: Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer. First of all, lets talk about this troop funding issue because John always brings this up. Senator McCain cut -- Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didnt believe in a timetable.I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable. We didnt have a difference on whether or not we were going to be funding troops.We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy. And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.The question is, was this wise? We have seen Afghanistan worsen, deteriorate. We need more troops there. We need more resources there. Senator McCain, in the rush to go into Iraq, said, you know what? Weve been successful in Afghanistan. There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.This is a time when bin Laden was still out, and now theyve reconstituted themselves. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.But we cant do it if we are not willing to give Iraq back its country. Now, what Ive said is we should end this war responsibly. We should do it in phases. But in 16 months we should be able to reduce our combat troops, put -- provide some relief to military families and our troops and bolster our efforts in Afghanistan so that we can capture and kill bin Laden and crush al Qaeda.And right now, the commanders in Afghanistan, as well as Admiral Mullen, have acknowledged that we dont have enough troops to deal with Afghanistan because we still have more troops in Iraq than we did before the surge.: Thats not the case.: What he said was a precipitous...: ... withdrawal would be dangerous. He did not say that. Thats not true.: Yes, I think we need more troops. Ive been saying that for over a year now.And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because its been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002. And we are seeing a major offensive taking place -- al Qaeda and Taliban crossing the border and attacking our troops in a brazen fashion. They are feeling emboldened.And we cannot separate Afghanistan from Iraq, because what our commanders have said is we dont have the troops right now to deal with Afghanistan.So I would send two to three additional brigades to Afghanistan. Now, keep in mind that we have four times the number of troops in Iraq, where nobody had anything to do with 9/11 before we went in, where, in fact, there was no al Qaeda before we went in, but we have four times more troops there than we do in Afghanistan.And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that al Qaeda is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan.So heres what we have to do comprehensively, though. Its not just more troops.We have to press the Afghan government to make certain that they are actually working for their people. And Ive said this to President Karzai.No. 2, weve got to deal with a growing poppy trade that has exploded over the last several years.No. 3, weve got to deal with Pakistan, because al Qaeda and the Taliban have safe havens in Pakistan, across the border in the northwest regions, and although, you know, under George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain, weve been giving them $10 billion over the last seven years, they have not done what needs to be done to get rid of those safe havens.And until we do, Americans here at home are not going to be safe.: Nobody talked about attacking Pakistan. Heres what I said.And if John wants to disagree with this, he can let me know, that, if the United States has al Qaeda, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out.Now, I think thats the right strategy; I think thats the right policy.And, John, I -- youre absolutely right that presidents have to be prudent in what they say. But, you know, coming from you, who, you know, in the past has threatened extinction for North Korea and, you know, sung songs about bombing Iran, I dont know, you know, how credible that is. I think this is the right strategy.Now, Senator McCain is also right that its difficult. This is not an easy situation. Youve got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.And weve got a choice. We could allow our troops to just be on the defensive and absorb those blows again and again and again, if Pakistan is unwilling to cooperate, or we have to start making some decisions.And the problem, John, with the strategy thats been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic. We had a 20th-century mindset that basically said, Well, you know, he may be a dictator, but hes our dictator.And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they werent going after al Qaeda, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan.Thats going to change when Im president of the United States.: Jim, let me just make a point. Ive got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck, sure another mother is not going through what Im going through.No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that theyve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step.And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision.And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can muddle through Afghanistan. You dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin Laden. You dont muddle through stamping out the Taliban.I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when Im president, I will.: A testimony to you, Jim.: Well, let me just correct something very quickly. I believe the Republican Guard of Iran is a terrorist organization. Ive consistently said so. What Senator McCain refers to is a measure in the Senate that would try to broaden the mandate inside of Iraq. To deal with Iran.And ironically, the single thing that has strengthened Iran over the last several years has been the war in Iraq. Iraq was Irans mortal enemy. That was cleared away. And what weve seen over the last several years is Irans influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon.So obviously, our policy over the last eight years has not worked. Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran. It would be a game changer. Not only would it threaten Israel, a country that is our stalwart ally, but it would also create an environment in which you could set off an arms race in this Middle East.Now heres what we need to do. We do need tougher sanctions. I do not agree with Senator McCain that were going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with some countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesnt have a nuclear weapon.But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked. It has not worked in Iran, it has not worked in North Korea. In each instance, our efforts of isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons. That will change when Im president of the United States.: So lets talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think its going to keep America safe.And Im glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy.Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, whos one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition. This is one of your own advisers.Now, understand what this means without preconditions. It doesnt mean that you invite them over for tea one day. What it means is that we dont do what weve been doing, which is to say, Until you agree to do exactly what we say, we wont have direct contacts with you.Theres a difference between preconditions and preparation. Of course weve got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.But I will point out that I was called naive when I suggested that we need to look at exploring contacts with Iran. And you know what? President Bush recently sent a senior ambassador, Bill Burns, to participate in talks with the Europeans around the issue of nuclear weapons.Again, it may not work, but if it doesnt work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.And when we havent done it, as in North Korea -- let me just take one more example -- in North Korea, we cut off talks. Theyre a member of the axis of evil. We cant deal with them.And you know what happened? They went -- they quadrupled their nuclear capacity. They tested a nuke. They tested missiles. They pulled out of the nonproliferation agreement. And they sent nuclear secrets, potentially, to countries like Syria.When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.And -- and I just -- so I just have to make this general point that the Bush administration, some of Senator McCains own advisers all think this is important, and Senator McCain appears resistant.He even said the other day that he would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasnt sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally.: If we cant meet with our friends, I dont know how were going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism.: Of course not.: Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks. Nobodys been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it. This is a mischaracterization of my position.When we talk about preconditions -- and Henry Kissinger did say we should have contacts without preconditions -- the idea is that we do not expect to solve every problem before we initiate talks.And, you know, the Bush administration has come to recognize that it hasnt worked, this notion that we are simply silent when it comes to our enemies. And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while hes spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous. Nobody is even talking about that.: No, let me tell...: We will take a look.: Nobodys talking about that.: I am not parsing words.: Im using the same words that your advisers use.Please, go ahead.: Well, I think that, given whats happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region.Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable. They were unwarranted. And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire. They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts. They are members of NATO.And to countries like Georgia and the Ukraine, I think we have to insist that they are free to join NATO if they meet the requirements, and they should have a membership action plan immediately to start bringing them in.Now, we also cant return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. Its important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation.They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but theyve got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of al Qaeda.This is an area where Ive led on in the Senate, working with a Republican ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar, to deal with the proliferation of loose nuclear weapons. Thats an area where were going to have to work with Russia.But we have to have a president who is clear that you dont deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul. You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?And we have to recognize that the way theyve been behaving lately demands a sharp response from the international community and our allies.: No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues. Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable. And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and thats why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.Because part of Russias intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.No. 1 is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems. So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory. That made no sense whatsoever.And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.That wasnt done. But had it been done, its possible we could have avoided the issue.The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy. Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the worlds oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states weve talked about, Iran, Venezuela.And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the worlds oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the worlds oil. So we cant simply drill our way out of the problem.What were going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology. And, you know, Ive got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that.And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.And so we -- we -- weve got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winters coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change thats so important.: Thats just not true, John. John, Im sorry, but thats not true.: I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.: John?: I -- I just have to correct the record here. I have never said that I object to nuclear waste. What Ive said is that we have to store it safely.And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.: Ive got to make this point, Jim.: He objects...: He -- he -- he objects...: He objected...: All right, fair enough. Lets move on. Youve got one more energy -- youve got one more question.: Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways. Obviously, weve poured billions of dollars into airport security. We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.Weve got to make sure that were hardening our chemical sites. We havent done enough in terms of transit; we havent done enough in terms of ports.And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies. Its in a suitcase.This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important. It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense. And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then were making a mistake.The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is al Qaeda. They are now operating in 60 countries. We cant simply be focused on Iraq. We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thats going to be critical. We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.And one last point I want to make. It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore Americas standing in the world. We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.: And this is the greatest country on Earth. But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.: Oh, theres no doubt. Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq. That has been their priority. That has been where all our resources have gone.In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed. Al Qaeda is resurgent.In the meantime, weve got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars. They now hold a trillion dollars worth of our debt. And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa. They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because weve been focused on Iraq.We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy. We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.And that means we cant provide health care to people who need it. We cant invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority. So this is a national security issue.We havent adequately funded veterans care. I sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and weve got -- I meet veterans all across the country who are trying to figure out, How can I get disability payments? Ive got post-traumatic stress disorder, and yet I cant get treatment.So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war. What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.Thats been missing over the last eight years. That sense is something that I want to restore.: Well, let me just make a closing point. You know, my father came from Kenya. Thats where I get my name.And in the 60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried. The ideals and the values of the United States inspired the entire world.I dont think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how were going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.And that is something that Im going to be committed to as president of the United States.\"\"\",\"\"\" Well, thank you, Jim. And thanks to everybody.And I do have a sad note tonight. Senator Kennedy is in the hospital. Hes a dear and beloved friend to all of us. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.And, Jim, I -- Ive been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But Im feeling a little better tonight, and Ill tell you why.Because as were here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that were in.And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And were not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street. Were talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we dont fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and Ive been around a little while.But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they werent part of the negotiations, and I understand that. And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight. This isnt the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.And weve got a lot of work to do. And weve got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.: I -- I hope so. And I... : Sure. : Sure. But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.But theres also the issue of responsibility. Youve mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.Somehow weve lost that accountability. Ive been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Weve got to start also holding people accountable, and weve got to reward people who succeed.But somehow in Washington today -- and Im afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.: Are you afraid I couldnt hear him?: No, I -- look, weve got to fix the system. Weve got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and on Wall Street.So theres no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that werent doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative. America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer.But weve got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America. And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us.: Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. Its completely out of control. Its gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us. And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because its a gateway. Its a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. I dont know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers money. And it has got to be brought under control.As president of the United States, I want to assure you, Ive got a pen. This ones kind of old. Ive got a pen, and Im going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk. I will make them famous. You will know their names.Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences. a million dollars for every day that hes been in the United States Senate.I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and theyll look at those projects.That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. Thats one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.: Well, again, I dont mean to go back and forth, but he...: Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States. He didnt happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.Maybe to Senator Obama its not a lot of money. But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time. Its only $18 billion. Do you know that its tripled in the last five years? Do you know that its gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people? It corrupts people.Thats why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges. Its a system thats got to be cleaned up.I have fought against it my career. I have fought against it. I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. I didnt win Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate.Now, Senator Obama didnt mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs.Now, thats a fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama. I want to cut spending. I want to keep taxes low. The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise peoples taxes.: Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.Right now, the United States of American business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent.Now, if youre a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where its 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, youre going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.But, again, I want to return. Its a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending. I can tell you, its rife. Its throughout.The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends. Look at them. Youll be appalled.And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5,000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America.I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obamas definition of rich.: Well, you know, let me just...: I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk.We had an energy bill before the United States Senate. It was festooned withChristmas tree ornaments. It had all kinds of breaks for the oil companies, I mean, billions of dollars worth. I voted against it; Senator Obama voted for it.: Youve got to look at our record. Youve got to look at our records. Thats the important thing.Who fought against wasteful and earmark spending? Who has been the person who has tried to keep spending under control?Whos the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair? And Ive fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it.Lets give every American a choice: two tax brackets, generous dividends, and, two -- and let Americans choose whether they want the -- the existing tax code or they want a new tax code.And so, again, look at the record, particularly the energy bill. But, again, Senator Obama has shifted on a number of occasions. He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year.: And thats just a fact. Again, you can look it up.: With all due respect, you already gave them to the oil companies.: Look, we, no matter what, weve got to cut spending. We have -- as I said, weve let government get completely out of control.Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate. Its hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.The point -- the point is -- the point is, we need to examine every agency of government.First of all, by the way, Id eliminate ethanol subsidies. I oppose ethanol subsidies.I think that we have to return -- particularly in defense spending, which is the largest part of our appropriations -- we have to do away with cost-plus contracts. We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.We tried to build a little ship called the Littoral Combat Ship that was supposed to cost $140 million, ended up costing $400 million, and we still havent done it.So we need to have fixed-cost contracts. We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control.I know how to do that.: I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong. And we fixed it and we killed it and the people ended up in federal prison so I know how to do this because Ive been involved these issues for many, many years. But I think that we have to examine every agency of government and find out those that are doing their job and keep them and find out those that arent and eliminate them and well have to scrub every agency of government.: How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs. I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions the caring of veterans national defense and several other vital issues.: Look, we are sending $700 billion a year overseas to countries that dont like us very much. Some of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist organizations. We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.Senator Obama opposes both storing and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. You cant get there from here and the fact is that we can create 700,000 jobs by building constructing 45 new nuclear power plants by the year 2030. Nuclear power is not only important as far as eliminating our dependence on foreign oil but its also responsibility as far as climate change is concerned and the issue I have been involved in for many, many years and Im proud of the work of the work that Ive done there along with President Clinton.: Well, I want to make sure were not handing the health care system over to the federal government which is basically what would ultimately happen with Senator Obamas health care plan. I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government. Look. We have to obviously cut spending. I have fought to cut spending. Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs. I would suggest he start by canceling some of those new spending program that he has.We cant I think adjust spending around to take care of the very much needed programs, including taking care of our veterans but I also want to say again a healthy economy with low taxes would not raising anyones taxes is probably the best recipe for eventually having our economy recover.And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that. And the reason, one of the major reasons why were in the difficulties we are in today is because spending got out of control. We owe China $500 billion. And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career. And I got plans to reduce and eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending and if theres anybody here who thinks there arent agencies of government where spending can be cut and their budgets slashed they have not spent a lot of time in Washington. Its well-known that I have not been elected Miss Congeniality in the United States Senate nor with the administration. I have opposed the president on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay. On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted. I have a long record and the American people know me very well and that is independent and a maverick of the Senate and Im happy to say that Ive got a partner thats a good maverick along with me now.: I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict. Our initial military success, we went in to Baghdad and everybody celebrated. And then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said, weve got to change this strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy and I fought for it. And finally, we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded.: And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy.The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence. It would have been increase in sectarian violence. It would have been a wider war, whichthe United States of America might have had to come back.So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded. And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home. And we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.: The next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not. The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. Thats the decision of the next president of the United States.Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. Incredibly, incredibly Senator Obama didnt go to Iraq for 900 days and never: Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO thats in Afghanistan. To this day, he has never had a hearing.: I mean, its remarkable.: Im afraid Senator Obama doesnt understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy. But the important -- Id like to tell you, two Fourths of July ago I was in Baghdad. General Petraeus invited Senator Lindsey Graham and me to attend a ceremony where 688 brave young Americans, whose enlistment had expired, were reenlisting to stay and fight for Iraqi freedom and American freedom.I was honored to be there. I was honored to speak to those troops. And you know, afterwards, we spent a lot of time with them. And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We dont want our kids coming back here.And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq.: They just passed an electoral...: An election law just in the last few days. There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you. They inform on the bad guys. And peace comes to the country, and prosperity.Thats whats happening in Iraq, and it wasnt a tactic.: It was a stratagem. And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general. And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.: Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obamas plan is dangerous for America.: Thats what ...: Thats what Admiral Mullen said.: And also General Petraeus said the same thing. Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground.Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obamas original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.And Im -- Im -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.: It didnt exceed beyond mine, because I know that thats a strategy that has worked and can succeed. But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obamas plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.: First of all, I wont repeat the mistake that I regret enormously, and that is, after we were able to help the Afghan freedom fighters and drive the Russians out of Afghanistan, we basically washed our hands of the region.And the result over time was the Taliban, al Qaeda, and a lot of the difficulties we are facing today. So we cant ignore those lessons of history.Now, on this issue of aiding Pakistan, if youre going to aim a gun at somebody, George Shultz, our great secretary of state, told me once, youd better be prepared to pull the trigger.Im not prepared at this time to cut off aid to Pakistan. So Im not prepared to threaten it, as Senator Obama apparently wants to do, as he has said that he would announce military strikes into Pakistan.Weve got to get the support of the people of -- of Pakistan. He said that he would launch military strikes into Pakistan.Now, you dont do that. You dont say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full. And this area on the border has not been governed since the days of Alexander the Great.Ive been to Waziristan. I can see how tough that terrain is. Its ruled by a handful of tribes.And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesnt understand, its got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq. Its going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.And were going to have to help the Pakistanis go into these areas and obtain the allegiance of the people. And its going to be tough. Theyve intermarried with al Qaeda and the Taliban. And its going to be tough. But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they dont want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.So weve got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan. But Im confident, now that General Petraeus is in the new position of command, that we will employ a strategy which not only means additional troops -- and, by the way, there have been 20,000 additional troops, from 32,000 to 53,000, and there needs to be more.So its not just the addition of troops that matters. Its a strategy that will succeed. And Pakistan is a very important element in this. And I know how to work with him. And I guarantee you I would not publicly state that Im going to attack them.: I -- I dont think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power. Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state.But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record.Back in 1983, when I was a brand-new United States congressman, the one -- the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon.And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldnt make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War. I supported -- I supported that.I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there.And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harms way.And Ill tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, Senator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my sons name on it.He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, I will -- I will wear his bracelet with honor.And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, But, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything -- promise me one thing, that youll do everything in your power to make sure that my sons death was not in vain.: A war that I was in, where we had an Army, that it wasnt through any fault of their own, but they were defeated. And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that. And it did and we will win this one and we wont come home in defeat and dishonor and probably have to go back if we fail. You might think that with that kind of concern that Senator Obama would have gone to Afghanistan, particularly given his responsibilities as a subcommittee chairman. By the way, when Im subcommittee chairman, we take up the issues under my subcommittee. But the important thing is -- the important thing is I visited Afghanistan and I traveled to Waziristan and I traveled to these places and I know what our security requirements are. I know what our needs are. So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.But the important thing is, if we suffer defeat in Iraq, which General Petraeus predicts we will, if we adopted Senator Obamas set date for withdrawal, then that will have a calamitous effect in Afghanistan and American national security interests in the region. Senator Obama doesnt seem to understand there is a connected between the two.: My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.Now we cannot a second Holocaust. Lets just make that very clear. What I have proposed for a long time, and Ive had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, lets be clear and lets have some straight talk. The Russians are preventing significant action in the United Nations Security Council.I have proposed a league of democracies, a group of people - a group of countries that share common interests, common values, common ideals, they also control a lot of the worlds economic power. We could impose significant meaningful, painful sanctions on the Iranians that I think could have a beneficial effect.The Iranians have a lousy government, so therefore their economy is lousy, even though they have significant oil revenues. So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior.But have no doubt, but have no doubt that the Iranians continue on the path to the acquisition of a nuclear weapon as we speak tonight. And it is a threat not only in this region but around the world.What Id also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran. There is the Republican Guard in Iran, which Senator Kyl had an amendment in order to declare them a sponsor of terror. Senator Obama said that would be provocative.So this is a serious threat. This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.: Senator Obama twice said in debates he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition. Without precondition. Here is Ahmadinenene [mispronunciation], Ahmadinejad, who is, Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the State of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and were going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimize and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena and therefore saying, theyve probably been doing the right thing, because you will sit down across the table from them and that will legitimize their illegal behavior.The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldnt sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika.Or whether it be Nixons trip to China, which was preceded by Henry Kissinger, many times before he went. Look, Ill sit down with anybody, but theres got to be pre-conditions. Those pre-conditions would apply that we wouldnt legitimize with a face to face meeting, a person like Ahmadinejad. Now, Senator Obama said, without preconditions.: Of course.: Im not going to set the White House visitors schedule before Im president of the United States. I dont even have a seal yet.Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad. He did not say that.: He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings. Ive always encouraged them. The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.What Senator Obama doesnt seem to understand that if without precondition you sit down across the table from someone who has called Israel a stinking corpse, and wants to destroy that country and wipe it off the map, you legitimize those comments.This is dangerous. It isnt just naive; its dangerous. And so we just have a fundamental difference of opinion.As far as North Korea is concerned, our secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went to North Korea. By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth. The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean, a huge gulag.We dont know what the status of the dear leaders health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that theyve entered into.And we ought to go back to a little bit of Ronald Reagans trust, but verify, and certainly not sit down across the table from -- without precondition, as Senator Obama said he did twice, I mean, its just dangerous.: So let me get this right. We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, Were going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth, and we say, No, youre not? Oh, please.: By the way, my friend, Dr. Kissinger, whos been my friend for 35 years, would be interested to hear this conversation and Senator Obamas depiction of his -- of his positions on the issue. Ive known him for 35 years.: And I guarantee you he would not -- he would not say that presidential top level.: Of course he encourages and other people encourage contacts, and negotiations, and all other things. We do that all the time.: And Senator Obama is parsing words when he says precondition means preparation.: Hes parsing words, my friends.: Well, I was interested in Senator Obamas reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia. His first statement was, Both sides ought to show restraint.Again, a little bit of naivete there. He doesnt understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government.I looked into Mr. Putins eyes, and I saw three letters, a K, a G, and a B. And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.I dont believe were going to go back to the Cold War. I am sure that that will not happen. But I do believe that we need to bolster our friends and allies. And that wasnt just about a problem between Georgia and Russia. It had everything to do with energy.Theres a pipeline that runs from the Caspian through Georgia through Turkey. And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.Its not accidental that the presidents of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine flew to Georgia, flew to Tbilisi, where I have spent significant amount of time with a great young president, Misha Saakashvili.: And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement. They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster. And this is -- this is Georgian territory. And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, Vladimir Putin, our president.It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia. They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.So, this is a very difficult situation. We want to work with the Russians. But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.And watch Ukraine. This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol. And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.So watch Ukraine, and lets make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.: No one from Arizona is against solar. And Senator Obama says hes for nuclear, but hes against reprocessing and hes against storing. So...: ... its hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements. And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil.: So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing...: ... I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didnt. That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.: I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...: No one can be opposed to alternate energy.: I think its much less than it was the day after 9/11. I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.And I want to tell you that one of the things Im most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle. I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration. And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40. And Im happy to say that weve gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission. Im proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services. We have to do a better job in human intelligence. And weve got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we dont ever torture a prisoner ever again.We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better. We have to work more closely with our allies. I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11. But that doesnt mean that we dont have a long way to go.And Id like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, weve probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department. And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.: But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, proven. That wasnt proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense. And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.We seem to come full circle again. Senator Obama still doesnt quite understand -- or doesnt get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages al Qaeda. They would establish a base in Iraq.The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that weve made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obamas plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but its very fragile. And we cant do what Senator Obama wants to do.That is the central issue of our time. And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether thats the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.: Ive been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge weve faced in the last 20-some years. There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.And I -- and I honestly dont believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience and has made the wrong judgments in a number of areas, including his initial reaction to Russian invasion -- aggression in Georgia, to his -- you know, weve seen this stubbornness before in this administration to cling to a belief that somehow the surge has not succeeded and failing to acknowledge that he was wrong about the surge is -- shows to me that we -- that -- that we need more flexibility in a president of the United States than that.As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans. I know them well. And I know that they know that Ill take care of them. And Ive been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.And I love them. And Ill take care of them. And they know that Ill take care of them. And thats going to be my job.But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America. I dont think I need any on-the-job training. Im ready to go at it right now.: Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.I guarantee you, as president of the United States, I know how to heal the wounds of war, I know how to deal with our adversaries, and I know how to deal with our friends.\"\"\",\"\"\": Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?First response to you, Senator Obama. You have two minutes.: Senator McCain, two minutes.: All right, lets go back to my question. How do you all stand on the recovery plan? And talk to each other about it. Weve got five minutes. We can negotiate a deal right here.But, I mean, are you -- do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain? Do you -- are you in favor of this plan?: Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain? : As a United States senator... : ... youre going to vote for the plan? : Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?: Say it directly to him.: Say it directly to him.: Im just determined to get you all to talk to each other. Im going to try.: So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said? And, if you dont, tell him what you disagree with.: All right, lets go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject.And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain. And using your word fundamental, are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obamas approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?: Senator Obama, two minutes.: Senator McCain?: No, thats fine.: Respond directly to him about that, to Senator Obama about that, about the -- hes made it twice now, about your tax -- your policies about tax cuts.: Senator Obama, you have a question for Senator McCain on that?: All right.: Weve got to go to another lead question.: All right. All right, speaking of things that both of you want, another lead question, and it has to do with the rescue -- the financial rescue thing that we started -- started asking about.And what -- and the first answer is to you, Senator Obama. As president, as a result of whatever financial rescue plan comes about and the billion, $700 billion, whatever it is its going to cost, what are you going to have to give up, in terms of the priorities that you would bring as president of the United States, as a result of having to pay for the financial rescue plan?: Are you -- what priorities would you adjust, as president, Senator McCain, because of the -- because of the financial bailout cost?: But if I hear the two of you correctly neither one of you is suggesting any major changes in what you want to do as president as a result of the financial bailout? Is that what youre saying?: Like what?: Not willing to give that up?: What Im trying to get at this is this. Excuse me if I may, senator. Trying to get at that you all -- one of you is going to be the president of the United States come January. At the -- in the middle of a huge financial crisis that is yet to be resolved. And what Im trying to get at is how this is going to affect you not in very specific -- small ways but in major ways and the approach to take as to the presidency.: Spending freeze?: Would you go for that?: Before we go to another lead question. Let me figure out a way to ask the same question in a slightly different way here. Are you -- are you willing to acknowledge both of you that this financial crisis is going to affect the way you rule the country as president of the United States beyond the kinds of things that you have already -- I mean, is it a major move? Is it going to have a major affect?: Quick response to Senator Obama.: All right. Lets go another subject. Lead question, two minutes to you, senator McCain. Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam. What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?: Two minutes, how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama?: Do you agree with that, the lesson of Iraq?: Well, lets go at some of these things...: What about that point?: All right. What about that point?: I know, OK, lets go to the latter point and well back up. The point about your not having been...: Senator Obama...: I have got a lot on the plate here...: Let me see...: Afghanistan, lead -- a new -- a new lead question. Now, having resolved Iraq, well move to Afghanistan.And it goes to you, Senator Obama, and its a -- it picks up on a point thats already been made. Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?: Afghanistan, Senator McCain?: New ...: I have some good news and bad news for the two of you. You all are even on time, which is remarkable, considering weve been going at it ...: I dont know about that. But the bad news is all my little five minute things have run over, so, anyhow, well adjust as we get there. But the amount of time is even.New lead question. And it goes two minutes to you, Senator McCain, what is your reading on the threat to Iran right now to the security of the United States?: Two minutes on Iran, Senator Obama.: Senator, what about talking?: Were going to go to a new...: New lead question.Russia, goes to you, two minutes, Senator Obama. How do you see the relationship with Russia? Do you see them as a competitor? Do you see them as an enemy? Do you see them as a potential partner?: Two minutes on Russia, Senator McCain.: You see any -- do you have a major difference with what he just said?: Weve got time for one more lead question segment. Were way out of...: Quick response and then...: Excuse me, Senator.: All right.: OK.: One at a time, please.: One at a time.: This is the last -- last lead question. You have two minutes each. And the question is this, beginning with you, Senator McCain.What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?: Two minutes, Senator Obama.: Do you agree theres much to be done in a new administration to restore...: You see the same connections that Senator McCain does?: Few seconds. Were almost finished.: And that ends this debate tonight.On October 2, next Thursday, also at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, the two vice presidential candidates will debate at Washington University in St. Louis. My PBS colleague, Gwen Ifill, will be the moderator.For now, from Oxford, Mississippi, thank you, senators, both. Im Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night. \"\"\"\n",
      "October 13 2004 ,Senator Kerry,President Bush,\"\"\"Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight. Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us. And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. Were proud to be here. Mr. President, Im glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people. Will we ever be safe and secure again? Yes, we absolutely must be. Thats the goal. Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it. I believe that this President, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away, and as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. The measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this President had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America, containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them95 percent come in today uninspected. Thats not good enough. People who fly on airplanes todaythe cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. Thats not good enough. Firehouses dont have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the President decided to cut the COPS program. So we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we go after the terrorists. I will hunt them down, and well kill them. Well capture them. Well do whats ever necessary to be safe. But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence, and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure. Yes. When the President had an opportunity to capture or kill Usama bin Laden, he took his focus off of him, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Usama bin Laden escaped. Six months after he said, Usama bin Laden must be caught, dead or alive, this President was asked, Where is Usama bin Laden? He said, I dont know. I dont really think about him very much. Im not that concerned. We need a President who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror. This really underscores the problem with the American health care system. Its not working for the American family, and its gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years. Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You got about a million right here in Arizonajust shy, 950,000who have no health insurance at all. Eighty-two thousand Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bushs watch. Two hundred and twenty-three thousand kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all. All across our countrygo to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance; 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush. This President has turned his back on the wellness of America, and there is no system. In fact, its starting to fall apart, not because of lawsuitsthough they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing thembut because of the larger issue that we dont cover Americans. Children across our country dont have health care. Were the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. I have a plan to cover all Americans. Were going to make it affordable and accessible. Were going to let everybody buy into the same health care plan the Senators and Congressmen give themselves. Actually, its not an empty promise. Its really interesting because the President used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, If its good enough for the Congressmen and Senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice. What we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other Senators, other Congressman choose other programs. But the fact is were going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. Were not giving this away for nothing. Ill tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go. During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you were going to pay for it and how. President Bush has takenhes the only President in history to do this. Hes also the only President sincein 72 years to lose jobs, 1.6 million jobs lost. Hes the only President to have incomes of families go down for the last 3 years, the only President to see exports go down, the only President to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. Now, Im going to reverse that. Im going to change that. Were going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s. Every plan that I have laid out, my health care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans, Ive shown exactly how Im going to pay for those. And we startwe dont do it exclusively, but we start by rolling back George Bushs unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain/Kerry commission, which identified some $60 billion that we can get. We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days, $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and to people importing ceiling fans from China. Im going to stand up and fight for the American worker, and Im going to do it in a way thats fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education. I have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks. This President has never once vetoed one bill, the first President in 100 years not to do that. I want you to notice how the President switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally. Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the President said about fiscal responsibility. Being lectured by the President on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. [Laughter] This President has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent. Tuitions have gone up 35 percent, gasoline prices up 30 percent. Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago. Prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. But guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that were losing, and the President just walks on by this problem. The fact is that hes cut job training money. A billion dollars was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because its an election year. Theyve cut the Pell grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. Theyve cut the training money. Theyve wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. Im going to do those things because thats what right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect. I dont blame them entirely for it. I blame the President for the things the President could do that has an impact on it. Outsourcing is going to happen. Ive acknowledged that in union halls across the country. Ive had shop stewards stand up and say, Will you promise me youre going to stop all this outsourcing? And Ive looked them in the eye and Ive said, No, I cant do that. What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system, that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job. Today, if youre an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes. So if youre looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. Thats not smart. I dont want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when Im President, were going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond, and were going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations 5 percent. And were going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This President didnt stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules with subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after Ive been talking about it for months. The fact is that the President had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told, Dont even bother. Were not going to listen to it. The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we havent stood up and fought for. Im going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. Thats what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact. Plus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, well do a lot better. Bob, anybody can play with these votes; everybody knows that. I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts. But you know why the Pell grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualified for them, because they dont have money. But theyre not getting the $5,100 the President promised them. Theyre getting less money. There are more people who qualify. Thats not what we want. Were all Gods children, Bob, and I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheneys daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that shes being who she was. Shes being who she was born as. I think if you talk to anybody, its not choice. Ive met people whove struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it. And Ive met wives who are supportive of their husbands, or vice versa, when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them. I think we have to respect that. The President and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, were a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you cant discriminate in the workplace. You cant discriminate in the rights that you afford people. You cant disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why Im for partnership rights and so forth. Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the States have always been able to manage those laws, and theyre proving today, every State, that they can manage them adequately. I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic, and I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many. I believe that I cant legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesnt share that article of faith. I believe that choice is a womans choice. Its between a woman, God, and her doctor, and thats why I support that. Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life, this has made a difference to me. And as President Kennedy said when he ran for President, he said, Im not running to be a Catholic President. Im running to be a President who happens to be Catholic. Now, my faith affects everything that I do and choose. Theres a great passage of the Bible that says, What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith, if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people. Thats why I fight against poverty. Thats why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this Earth. Thats why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith. But I know this, that President Kennedy, in his Inaugural Address, told all of us that, Here on Earth, Gods work must truly be our own. And thats what we have toso I think thats the test of public service. The reason health care costs are getting higherone of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of commonsense efforts that would have reduced the costs. Let me give you a prime example. In the Senate, we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. But the President and his friends took it out in the House, and now you dont have that right. The President blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada. We also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. The VA does that. The VA provides lower cost drugs to our veterans. We could have done that in Medicare. Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors who are many of themon fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. But rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs, the President made it illegalillegalfor Medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices. Result: $139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets. Thats a large part of your 17-percent increase in Medicare premiums. When Im President, Im sending that back to Congress, and were going to get a real prescription drug benefit. Now, we also have people sicker because they dont have health insurance. So whether its diabetes or cancer, they come to the hospitals later, and it costs America more. Weve got to have health care for all Americans. Once again, the President is misleading America. Ive actually passed 56 individual bills that Ive personally written. And in addition to that, theyre not always under my name; there is amendments on certain bills. But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped writeI did writeI was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s. And Im very proud of that. So the Presidents wrong. Thats correct. Well, two leading national news networks have both said the Presidents characterization of my health care plan is incorrect. One called it fiction. The other called it untrue. The fact is that my health care plan, America, is very simple. It gives you the choice. I dont force you to do anything. Its not a Government plan. The Government doesnt require you to do anything. You choose your doctor. You choose your plan. If you dont want to take the offer of the plan that I want to put forward, you dont have to. You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits. But I got a better plan, and I dont think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today. Heres what I do. We take over Medicaid children from the States so that every child in America is covered. And in exchange, if the States want totheyre not forced to; they can choose tothey cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty. Its their choice. I think theyll choose it, because its a net plus of $5 billion to them. We allow youif you choose to; you dont have tobut we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that Senators and Congressmen give themselves. If its good enough for us, its good enough for every American. I believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in Washington, DC. If you want to buy into it, you can. We give you broader competition. That helps lower prices. In addition to that, were going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And most importantly, we give small business a 50-percent tax credit so that after we lower the cost of health care, they also get, whether theyre self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees. Now, what happens is, when you begin to get people covered like thatfor instance, in diabetes, if you diagnose diabetes early, you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis. It works, and Im going to offer it to America. The President just said that Government-run health care results in poor quality. Now, maybe that explains why he hasnt fully funded the VA, and the VA hospital is having trouble, and veterans are complaining. Maybe that explains why Medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of Medicarehe doesnt adequately fund it. But let me just say to America, I am not proposing a Government-run program. Thats not what I have. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Senators and Congressmen have a wide choice. Americans ought to have it too. You just heard the President say that young people ought to be able to take money out of Social Security and put it in their own accounts. Now, my fellow Americans, thats an invitation to disaster. The CBO said very clearly that if you were to adopt the Presidents plan, there will be a $2 trillion hole in Social Security, because todays workers pay into the system for todays retirees. And the CBO saidthats the Congressional Budget Office; its bipartisanthey said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 to 40 percent. Now, the President has never explained to Americaever; hasnt done it tonight where does the transitional money, that $2 trillion, come from? Hes already got $3 trillion, according to the Washington Post, of expenses that hes put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign, none of which are paid for not one of them are paid for. The fact is that the President is driving the largest deficits in American history. Hes broken the pay-as-you-go rules. I have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility. In 1985, I was one of the first Democrats broke with my partywe balanced the budget in the nineties. We paid down the debt for 2 years. And thats what were going to do. Were going to protect Social Security. I will not privatize it. I will not cut the benefits. And were going to be fiscally responsible, and we will take care of Social Security. Not at all. Absolutely not, Bob. This is the same thing we heard I remember I appeared on Meet the Press with Tim Russert in 1990-somethingwe heard the same thing. We fixed it. In fact, we put together a $5.6 trillion surplus in the nineties that was for the purpose of saving Social Security. If you take the tax cut that the President of the United States has givenPresident Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America, just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075. The President decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut. Now, Alan Greenspan, who I think has done a terrific job in monetary policy, supports the Presidents tax cut. I dont. I support it for the middle class, not that part of it that goes to people earning more than $200,000 a year. And when I roll it back and we invest in the things that Ive talked about to move our economy, were going to grow sufficiently that we begin to cut the deficit in half, and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country. Now, we can do that. Now, if later on, after a period of time, we find that Social Security is in trouble, then well pull together the top experts of the country. Well do exactly what we did in the 1990s, and well make whatever adjustment is necessary. But the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in America. The jobs the President is creating pay $9,000 less than the jobs that were losing. And this is the first President in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs1.6 million jobs. Eleven other Presidentssix Democrats and five Republicanshad wars, had recessions, had great difficulties. None of them lost jobs the way this President has. I have a plan to put America back to work. And if were fiscally responsible and put America back to work, were going to fix Social Security. Let me just answer one part of that last question quickly, and then Ill come to immigration. The American middle-class family isnt making it right now, Bob, and what the President said about the tax cuts have been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs. The fact is the take-home pay of a typical American family as a share of national income is lower than its been since 1929. And the take-home pay of the richest 1 percent of Americans is the highest its been since 1928. Under President Bush, the middle class has seen their tax burden go up, and the wealthiest tax burden has gone down. Now, thats wrong. Now, with respect to immigration reform, the President broke his promise on immigration reform. He said he would reform it. Four years later, hes now promising another plan. Heres what Ill do. Number one, the borders are more leaking today than they were before 9/11. The fact is we havent done what we need to do to toughen up our borders, and I will. Secondly, we need a guest-worker program, but if its all we have, its not going to solve the problem. The second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring. Its against the law in the United States to hire people illegally, and we ought to be enforcing that law properly. And thirdly, we need an earned legalization program for people whove been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American. Weve got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows. Four thousand people a day are coming across the border. The fact is that we now have people from the Middle Eastallegedlycoming across the border. And were not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology. We have iris identification technology. We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today. We can know who the people are, that theyre really the people they say they are, when they cross the border. We could speed it up. There are huge delays. The fact is, our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and Ill make them secure. Well, Im glad you raised that question. Its long-overdue time to raise the minimum wage. And America, this is one of those issues that separates the President and myself. We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years. But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate wont even let us have a vote on it. Were not allowed to vote on it. They dont want to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our Nation in 50 years. If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9.2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year. The President has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesnt hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire. One percent of America got $89 billion last year in a tax cut. But people working hard, playing by the rules, trying to take care of their kidsfamily values that were supposed to value so much in AmericaIm tired of politicians who talk about family values and dont value families. What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold onto equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. Thats not right in America. And we have an initiative that we were working on to raise womens pay. Theyve cut it off. Theyve stopped it. They dont enforce these kinds of things. I think that it is a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage, 15 million Americans would be positively affected. Wed put money into the hands of people who work hard, who obey the rules, who play for the American Dream. And if we did that, wed have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear. I will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage. Is that a new question, or a 30-second question? Which time limit are we Thank you very much. Well, again, the President didnt answer the question. I will answer it straight to America. Im not going to appoint a judge to the court who is going to undo a constitutional right, whether its the first amendment or the fifth amendment or some other right thats given under our courts today under the Constitution. And I believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right. So, I dont intend to see it undone. Clearly, the President wants to leave an ambivalence or intends to undo it. Let me go a step further. We have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in America. I dont know how you can govern in this country when you look at New York City and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed, when you see 40 percent of Hispanic children, of black children in some cities dropping out of high school. And yet the President, who talks about No Child Left Behind, refused to fully fundby $28 billionthat particular program, so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people. Now, right here in Arizona, that difference would have been $131 million to the State of Arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens. The President reneged on his promise to fund No Child Left Behind. He will tell you hes raised the money, and he has, but he didnt put in what he promised. And that makes a difference in the lives of our children. You dont measure it by a percentage increase. Mr. President, you measure it by whether youre getting the job done. Five hundred thousand kids lost after-school programs because of your budget. Now, thats not in my gut. Thats not my value systemand certainly not so that the wealthiest people in America can walk away with another tax cut: $89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of Americans, but kids lost their after-school programs. You be the judge. Well, I think the fact that theyre facing these repeated callups, some of them two and three deployments, and theres a stop-loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up, is a reflection of the bad judgment this President exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces. Our military is overextended. Nine out of ten Active Duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq, or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, theyre wrapped up in it. Now, Ive proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the Armed Forces of the United States, one combat, one support. In addition, Im going to double the number of special forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve. And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country. Theres much we can do with them with respect to homeland security. We ought to be doing that, and that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure. But the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of our Armed Forces is, frankly, to run a foreign policy that recognizes that America is strongest when we are working with real alliances, when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side. Ive said it before; I say it again: I believe the President broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this Nation to war. He said he would work through thea real alliance. He said in Cincinnati, We would plan carefully. We would take every precaution. Well, we didnt, and the result is our forces today are overextended. The fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last resort. And America now is paying already 120 billion, up to 200 billion before were finished and much more, probably, and that is the result of this President taking his eye off of Usama bin Laden. I have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation. In fact, Ive said the opposite. I will never turn the security of the United States over to any nation. No nation will ever have a veto over us. But I think it makes senseI think most Americans in their guts know that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard. Thats how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and thats how you gain legitimacy in the world. But I will never fail to protect the United States of America. I believe it was a failure of Presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban. I am a hunter. Im a gun owner. Ive been a hunter since I was a kid, 12, 13 years old. And I respect the second amendment, and I will not tamper with the second amendment. But Ill tell you this. Im also a former law enforcement officer. I ran one of the largest district attorney offices in America, one of the 10 largest. Ive put people behind bars for the rest of their life. Ive broken up organized crime. I know something about prosecuting. And most of the law enforcement agencies in America wanted that assault weapons ban. They dont want to go into a drug bust and be facing an AK-47. I was hunting in Iowa last year with the sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us and said, See that house over there? We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. Because of the Presidents decision today, law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous. Terrorists can now come into America and go to a gun show and, without even a background check, buy an assault weapon today. And thats what Usama bin Ladens handbook said, because we captured it in Afghanistan, and it encouraged them to do it. So I believe America is less safe. If Tom DeLay or someone in the House said to me, Sorry, we dont have the votes, Id have said, Then were going to have a fight. And Id have taken it out to the country, and Id have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those Congressmen. Wed have won what Bill Clinton won. No, Bob, regrettably, we have not moved far enough along. And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along. Ill give you an example. Im theI served on the Small Business Committee for a long time. I was chairman of it once; now Im the senior Democrat on it. We used towe have a goal there for minority set-aside programs to try to encourage ownership in the country. They dont reach those goals. They dont even fight to reach those goals. Theyve tried to undo them. The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination, and affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color. Some people have a mistaken view of it in America. It also is with respect to women. Its with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country. I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably. If you look at whats happened, weve made progress; I want to say that at the same time. During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action. And there were many people, like myself, who opposed quotas, who felt there were places where it was overreaching. So we had a policy called mend it, dont end it. We fixed it. And we fixed it for a reason, because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism. And so we have a distance to travel. As President, I will make certain we travel it. Now, let me just share something. This President is the first President ever, I think, not to meet with the NAACP. This is a President who hasnt met with the Black Congressional Caucus. This is a President who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country. If a President doesnt reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers? I see that as part of my job as President, and Ill make my best effort to do it. Well, I respect everything that the President has said, and certainly I respect his faith. I think its important, and I share it. I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty. Everything is a gift from the Almighty. And as I measure the words of the Bibleand we all do; different people measure different things, the Koran, the Torah, or Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being, and people all find their ways to express it. I was taughtI went to a church school, and I was taught that the two greatest commandments are Love the Lord, your God, with all your mind, your body, and your soul and Love your neighbor as yourself. And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet. We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America. Theres one for the people who have, and theres one for the people who dont have. And were struggling with that today. The President and I have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith. I talked about it earlier when I talked about the works and faith without works being dead. I think weve got a lot more work to do. And as President, I will always respect everybodys right to practice religion as they choose or not to practice, because thats part of America. Well, very much so. Let me pay a compliment to the President, if I may. I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the President did a terrific job. And I really was moved as well as impressed by the speech that he gave to the Congress. And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans; we were all just Americans. Thats where we were. Thats not where we are today. I regret to say that the President, who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. Ive never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. Ive never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way theyre locked out today. We have to change that, and as President, I am committed to changing that. I dont care if the idea comes from the other side or this side. I think we have to come together and work to change it. And Ive done that. Over 20 years in the United States Senate, Ive worked with John McCain, whos sitting here. Ive worked with other colleagues. Ive reached across the aisle. Ive tried to find the common ground, because thats what makes us strong as Americans. And if Americans trust me with the Presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effortopenly, not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside, but a genuine effort to try to restore Americas hope and possibilities by bringing people together. And one of the ways were going to do it is, Im going to work with my friend John McCain to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people so America is really represented by the people who make up America. Well, I guess the President and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up. [Laughter] And some would say maybe me more so than others. [Laughter] But I can take it. [Laughter] Can I say, if I could just say a word about a woman that you didnt ask about, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, just before I was deciding to run. And she was in the hospital, and I went in to talk to her and tell her what I was thinking of doing. And she looked at me from her hospital bed, and she just looked at me, and she said, Remember, integrity, integrity, integrity. Those are the three words that she left me with. My fellow Americans, as you heard from Bob Schieffer a moment ago, America is being tested by division. More than ever, we need to be united as a country. And like Franklin Roosevelt, I dont care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America and whether its going to make us stronger. These are dangerous times. I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of a troubled world. And I believe that we can, together, do things that are within the grasp of Americans. We can lift our schools up. We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs were losing overseas. We can have health care for all Americans. We can further the cause of equality in our Nation. Let me just make it clear: I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security. Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this Nation that I love. And with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher. I believe we can do better. I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. And I ask you to embark on that journey with me. I ask you for your trust. I ask you for your help. I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great Nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever. Thank you. Good night, and God bless the United States of America. \"\"\",\"\"\"Bob, thank you very much. I want to thank Arizona State as well. Yes, we can be safe and secure if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world. I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down Al Qaida, wherever it existsand were making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justicebut to make sure that countries who harbor terrorists are held to account. As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march. We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein. In other words, in order to make sure were secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. My opponent, just this weekend, talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution and illegal gambling. I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I dont think you can secure America for the long run if you dont have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people. At home, well do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it. Were doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports. But absolutely, we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership. Gosh, I dont think I ever said Im not worried about Usama bin Laden. Thats kind of one of those exaggerations. Of course, were worried about Usama bin Laden. Were on the hunt after Usama bin Laden. Were using every asset at our disposal to get Usama bin Laden. My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this is awar is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected. Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didnt allow contaminated medicine into our country. Were working with Canada to, hopefullythat theyll produce ahelp us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season. My call to our fellow Americans is, if youre healthy, if youre younger, dont get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young. The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly. I havent gotten a flu shot, and I dont intend to, because I want to make sure that those who are most vulnerable get treated. We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and so, therefore, they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine. One of the reasons Im such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people arent afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law. But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England, is for those of us who are younger and healthy, dont get a flu shot. I would, thank you. I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you cant pay for. He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy into the same plan that Senators and Congressman get. That costs the Government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up like the Senator suggested, it would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years. Its an empty promise. Its called bait and switch. Thank you. Well, his rhetoric doesnt match his record. Hes been a Senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. He talks about being a fiscal conservative or fiscally sound, but he voted overhe voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion. He talks about pay-goIll tell you what pay-go means when youre a Senator from Massachusetts, when youre a colleague of Ted Kennedy: Pay-go means you pay, and he goes ahead and spends. Hes proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises 600 million by our accountbillion800 billion by his account. There is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class. I proposed a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, Heres how were going to reduce the deficit in half by 5 years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the Halls of Congress. I say, Bob, Ive got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century, and heres some help for you to go get an education. Heres some help for you to go to a community college. Weve expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. You know, theres a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing, and we talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. And so we said, Lets raise the standards. Were spending more money, but lets raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before its too late. You know, education is how to help the person who has lost a job. Education is how to make sure thisweve got a workforce thats productive and competitive. You got4 more years, Ive got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell grants, to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. And so to the person you talked to, I say, Heres some help. Heres some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go to a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. And thats what wed say to that person. Whoo! Let me start with the Pell grants. In his last litany of misstatements, he said we cut Pell grants. Weve increased Pell grants by a million students. Thats a fact. Here he talks to the workers; let me talk to the workers. You got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed. If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. Thats money in your pocket. If youre married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage. We created a 10-percent bracket to help lower income Americans. A family of four making 40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief. Its your money. The way my opponent talks, he said were going to spend the Governments money. No, were spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, youre able to better afford things you want. I believe the role of Government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives. My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric. He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times. Senator, no one is playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they votedwhen they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times. You voted to violate the budget caps 277 times. You know, theres a mainstream in American politics. You sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative Senator from Massachusetts. You know, Bob, I dont know. I just dont know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America, and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. Its important that we do that. I also know, in a free society, people, consenting adults, can live the way they want to live. And thats to be honored. But as we respect someones rights and as we profess tolerance, we shouldnt changeor have to change our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think its very important that we protect marriage as an institution between a man and a woman. I proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage. And the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, State legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution. Im deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. My opponent was against it. It basically protected States from the action of one State to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But Im concerned that that will get overturned, and if it gets overturned, then well end up with marriage being defined by courts. And I dont think thats in our Nations interest. I think its important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand theres great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. Take, for example, the ban on partial-birth abortion. Its a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the Halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that hes out of the mainstream, voted against that law. What Im saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: Continue to promote adoption lawsthats a great alternative to abortion; continue to fund and promote maternity group homes. I will continue to promote abstinence programs. At the last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. Thats great, and I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion. Gosh, I sure hope its not the administration. [Laughter] No, there is alook, theres a systemic problem. Health care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decisionmaking process. Most health care costs are covered by third parties, and therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And theres no market forces involved with health care. Its one of the reasons Im a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute; employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decisionmaking process on health care. Secondly, I do believe the lawsuitsI dont believe, I knowthat the lawsuits are causing health care costs to rise in America. Thats why Im such a strong believer in medical liability reform. At the last debate, my opponent said, Well, they onlythese lawsuits only cause costs to go up by one percent. Well, he didnt include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the Federal Government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between 60 and 100 billion dollars a year. Thirdly, one of the reasons why theres still high costs in medicine is because this is thethey dont use information technology. Its like if you looked at theits the equivalent of the buggy-and-horse days compared to other industries here in America. And so weve got to introduce high technology into health care. Were beginning to do it. Were changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error as well as to reduce costs. People tell me that when the health care field is fully integrated with information technology, it will wring some 20 percent of the costs out of the system. And finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. So, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care. I think its important, since he talked about the Medicare plan hes been in the United States Senate for 20 years. He has no record on reforming of health care, no record at all. He introduced some 300 bills, and hes passed 5 no record of leadership. I came to Washington to solve problems. I was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food, and so I led. And in 2006, our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in Medicare. In all due respect, Im not so sure its credible to quote leading news organizations aboutwell, never mind. Anyway[laughter]let me quote the Lewin report. The Lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated. They analyzed the Senators plan. It costs $1.2 trillion. The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million peopleover 20 million people added to Government-controlled health care. It will be the largest increase in Government health care ever. If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees. Why should they insure somebody when the Government is going to insure for them? Its estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to Government insurance. We have a fundamental difference of opinion. I think Government-run health will lead to poor quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice. Once a health care program ends up in a line item in the Federal Government budget, it leads to more controls. And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care. They have poor quality health care. Our health care system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by officials in the Nations Capital. You talk about the VA. Weve increased VA funding by 22 billion in the 4 years since Ive been President. Thats twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding. Of course, were meeting our obligation to our veterans, and the veterans know that. Were expanding veterans health care throughout the country. Were aligning facilities where the veterans live now. Veterans are getting very good health care under my administration, and they will continue to do so during the next 4 years. Bob, first let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when were talking about reforming Social Security, that theyll still get their checks. I remember the 2000 campaign; people said, If George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away. Well, people got their checks, and they will continue to get their checks. There is a problem for our youngsters, a real problem, and if we dont act today, the problem will be valued in the trillions. And so I think we need to think differently. Well honor our commitment to our seniors, but for youngfor our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy. In recognizing that, I called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue. It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at. I believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account, because I understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current Social Security trust. And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren. I will work with Republicans and Democrats. This will be a vital issue in my second term. It is an issue that Im willing to take on. And so Ill bring Republicans and Democrats together, and were of course going to have to consider the costs. But I want to warn my fellow citizens the cost of doing nothing, the cost of saying the current system is okay, far exceeds the cost of trying to make sure we save the system for our children. He forgot to tell you he voted to tax Social Security benefits more than one time. I didnt hear any plan to fix Social Security. I heard more of the same. He talks about middle-class tax cuts; thats exactly where the tax cuts went. Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans. And now the Tax Code is more fair; 20 percent of the upper income people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in America today because of how we structured the tax cuts. People listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed. If you have a child, you got tax relief. If youre married, you got tax relief. If you pay any tax at all, you got tax relief, all of which was opposed by my opponent. And the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession. People need to remember, 6 months prior to my arrival, the stock market started to go down, and it was one of the largest declines in our history. And then we had a recession, and we got attacked, which cost us one million jobs. But we acted. I led the Congress. We passed tax relief. And now this economy is growing. We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months. Sure, theres more work to do. But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners. Its not to increase the scope of the Federal Government. Its to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low. I see it as a serious problem. I see it as a security issue; I see it as an economic issue; and I see it as a human rights issue. Were increasing the border security of the United States. Weve got 1,000 more Border Patrol agents on the southern border. Were using new equipment. Were using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across, and well continue to do so over the next 4 years. This is a subject Im very familiar with. After all, I was a border Governor for a while. Many people are coming to this country for economic reasons. Theyre coming here to work. If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America5.15youre going to come here if youre worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And thats whats happening. And so, in order to take pressure off the border, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary-worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate upso long as theres not an American willing to do the jobto join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers needs. That has the benefit of making sure our employers arent breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs. It makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated, that theyre not kept in the shadows of our society, that theyre able to go back and forth to see their families. See, the card will have a period of time attached to it. It also means it takes pressure off the border. If somebody is coming here to work with a card, it means theyre not going to have to sneak across the border. It means our Border Patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job. Now, its very important for our citizens to also know that I dont believe we ought to have amnesty. I dont think we ought to reward illegal behavior. There are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen, and we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line. If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line too. And heres where my opponent and I differ. In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens. Well, to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to September the 11th shows he doesnt know the borders. Theyre much better protected today than they were when I was the Governor of Texas. Weve got much more manpower, much more equipment there. He just doesnt understand how the borders work, evidently, to say that. That is an outrageous claim. And well continue to protect our borders. Well continue to increase manpower and equipment. Actually, Mitch McConnell had a minimum wage plan that I supported that would have increased the minimum wage. But let me talk about whats really important for the worker youre referring to, and thats to make sure the education system works, is to make sure we raise standards. Listen, the No Child Left Behind Act is really a jobs act when you think about it. The No Child Left Behind Act says, Well raise standards. Well increase Federal spending, but in return for extra spending, we now want people to measureStates and local jurisdictions to measure, to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract. You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem, and we werent diagnosing problems. And therefore, just kids were being shuffled through the school. And guess who would get shuffled through? Children whose parents wouldnt speak English as first language, just moved through; many inner-city kids, just moved through. Weve stopped that practice now by measuring early, and when we find a problem, we spend extra money to correct it. I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, telling me reading is the new civil right. And shes right. In order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century, weve got to get it right in the education system. And were beginning to close a minority achievement gap now. You see, wed never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesnt quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure theres excellence in every classroom. What hes asking me is will I have a litmus test for my judges, and the answer is no, I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the Constitution, but Ill have no litmus test. Two things: One, he clearly has a litmus test for his judges, which I disagree with. And secondly, only a liberal Senator from Massachusetts would say that a 49-percent increase in funding for education was not enough. Weve increased funds, but more importantly, weve reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early, before theyre too late. He talked about the unemployed. Absolutely, weve got to make sure they get educated. He talked about children whose parents dont speak English as a first language. Absolutely, weve got to make sure they get educated. And thats what the No Child Left Behind Act does. The best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in Iraq, is to train Iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy, is to give them a chance to defend their country, which is precisely what were doing. Well have 125,000 troops trained by the end of this year. I remember going on an airplane in Bangor, Maine, to say thanks to the Reservists and Guard that were headed overseas from Tennessee and North Carolina and Georgia. Some of them had been there before. The people I talked to, the spirits were high. They didnt view their service as a backdoor draft. They view their service as an opportunity to serve their country. My opponent, the Senator, talks about foreign policy. In our first debate, he proposed America pass a global test. In order to defend ourselves, we have to get international approval. Thats one of the major differences we have about defending our country. I work with allies. I work with friends. Well continue to build strong coalitions. But I will never turn over our national security decisions to leaders of other countries. Well be resolute. Well be strong, and we will wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists. In 1990, there was a vast coalition put together to run Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. The international community, the international world, said this is the right thing to do. But when it came time to authorize the use of force on the Senate floor, my opponent voted against the use of force. Apparently, you cant pass any test under his vision of the world. Actually, I made my intentionsI made my views clear. I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties. Now, I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun. I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns dont get in the hands of people that shouldnt have them. But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns. And thats why, early in my administration, I called the Attorney General and the U.S. attorneys and said, Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crime with guns. And the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent, I believe is the number. Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns. To me, thats the best way to secure America. Well, first of all, it is just not true that I havent met with the Black Congressional Caucus. I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House. And secondly, like my opponent, I dont agree we ought to have quotasI agree, we shouldnt have quotas. But we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated, to make sure when they get out of high school theres Pell grants available for them, which is what weve done. Weve expanded Pell grants by a million students. Do you realize, today in America, we spend $73 billion to help 10 million low- and middle-income families better afford college? Thats the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add, and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma. I believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through small-business loans, which we have increased since Ive been the President of the United States, but to unbundle Government contracts so people will have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going. Minority ownership of businesses are up because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong. I thinkI believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something. Today in America more minorities own a home than ever before. And thats hopeful, and thats positive. First, my faith plays a lota big part in my life. And thats when I was answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot, and I do. And my faith is a veryits very personal. I pray for strength. I pray for wisdom. I pray for our troops in harms way. I pray for my family. I pray for my little girls. But Im mindful, in a free society, that people can worship if they want to or not. Youre equally an American if you choose to worship an Almighty and if you choose not to. If youre a Christian, Jew, or Muslim, youre equally an American. Thats the great thing about America, is the right to worship the way you see fit. Prayer and religion sustain me. Ive received calmness in the storms of the Presidency. I love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country. Somebody asked me one time, Well, how do you know? I said, I just feel it. Religion is an important part. I never want to impose my religion on anybody else, but when I make decisions, I stand on principle. And the principles are derived from who I am. I believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself. Thats manifested in public policy through the Faith-Based Initiative, where weve unleashed the armies of compassion to help sealheal people who hurt. I believe that God wants everybody to be free. Thats what I believe. And thats part of my foreign policy. In Afghanistan, I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty, and I cant tell you how encouraged I am to see freedom on the march. And so my principles that I make decisions on are a part of me, and religion is a part of me. My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is. I had a record of working with Republicans and Democrats as the Governor of Texas, and I was hopeful to be able to do the same thing. And we made good progress early on. The No Child Left Behind Act, incredibly enough, was good work between me and my administration and people like Senator Ted Kennedy. And we worked together with Democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow. But Washington is a tough town, and the way I view it is theres a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are on one side of the issue or another, and they spend enormous sums of money, and they convince different Senators to tout their way or different Congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in. Ill continue in the 4 years to continue to try to work to do so. My opponent said this is a bitterly divided time. It was pretty divided in the 2000 election. So, in other words, its pretty divided during the 1990s as well. Were just in a period, and weve got to work to bring it out. My opponent keeps mentioning John McCain, and Im glad he did. John McCain is for me for President because he understands I have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in Iraq, and my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in Iraq. To listen to them [laughter]to stand up straight and not scowl. [Laughter] I love the strong women around me. I cant tell you how much I love my wife and our daughters. I am you know, its really interesting, I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech. I said, Okay, you got a deal. Fortunately, she didnt hold me to that deal, and shes out campaigning, along with our girls, and she speaks English a lot better than I do. [Laughter] I think people understand what shes saying. But they see a compassionate, strong, great First Lady in Laura Bush. I cant tell you how lucky I am when I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan ONeill in Midland, Texas. It was the classic backyard barbecue. ONeill said, Come on over. I think youll find somebody who might interest you. So I said, All right, popped over there. There was only four of us there, and not only did she interest me, I guess you could say it was love at first sight. In the Oval Office, theres a painting by a friend of Laura and mine namedby Tom Lea. Its a west Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene. And he said this about it, he said, Sarah and I live on the east side of the mountain. Its the sunrise side, not the sunset side. Its the side to see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone. I love the optimism in that painting because thats how I feel about America. You know, weve been through a lot together during the last 3 3/4 years. Weve come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing. Over the next 4 years, well make sure the economy continues to grow. We reformed our school system, and now theres an achievement gap in America that is beginning to close. Over the next 4 years, well continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in America so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of America. Over the next 4 years, well continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable. Over the next 4 years, well continue to rally the armies of compassion to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our countrys neighborhoods. Im optimistic that well win the war on terror, but I understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose. We must never waver in the face of this enemy thatthese ideologues of hate. And as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists, well also spread freedom and liberty. Weve got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies, to convert hostilea hostile world to a peaceful world. My hope for America is a prosperous America, a hopeful America, and a safer world. I want to thank you for listening tonight. Im asking for your vote. God bless you. \"\"\",\"\"\"As Jim Lehrer told you before the first one, these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight the topic will be domestic affairs, but the format will be the same as that first debate. Ill moderate our discussion under detailed rules agreed to by the candidates, but the questions and the areas to be covered were chosen by me. I have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are. To refresh your memory on the rules, I will ask a question. The candidate is allowed 2 minutes to answer. His opponent then has a minute and a half to offer a rebuttal. At my discretion, I can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional 30 seconds. A green light will come on to signal the candidate has 30 seconds left; a yellow light signals 15 seconds left; a red light means 5 seconds left. There is also a buzzer if it is needed. The candidates may not question each other directly. There are no opening statements, but there will be 2-minute closing statements. There is an audience here tonight, but they have agreed to remain silent, except for right now, when they join me in welcoming President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. Gentlemen, welcome to you both. By coin toss, the first question goes to Senator Kerry. Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight, and that is: Will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up? Mr. President, you have 90 seconds. Anything to add, Senator Kerry? Mr. President. New question, Mr. President, to you. Were talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year. Suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen? Senator Kerry. Mr. President, would you like to add something? Time is up. All right, Senator Kerry, a new question. Lets talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you all are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. My question is, how can you or any President, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that were running up to our children? Mr. President. Lets go to a new question, Mr. President, 2 minutes. And lets continue on jobs. You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual. Mr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who is being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States? Senator Kerry. New question to you, Senator Kerry, 2 minutes, and its still on jobs. You know, many experts say that a President really doesnt have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, thats progress. Thats not the Presidents fault. So I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs? Mr. President. Senator Kerry. Mr. President, lets get back to economic issues. But lets shift to some other questions here. Both of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question. Do you believe homosexuality is a choice? Senator Kerry. Senator Kerry, a new question for you. The New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a womans right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem cell research. What is your reaction to that? Mr. President. Mr. President, lets have a new question. It goes to you, and lets get back to economic issues. Health insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last 4 years, according to the Washington Post. Were paying more; were getting less. I would like to ask you, who bears responsibility for this? Is it the Government? Is it the insurance companies? Is it the lawyers? Is it the doctors? Is it the administration? Senator Kerry. Go ahead, Mr. President. Senator Kerry, 30 seconds. Let me direct the next question to you, Senator Kerry, and again, lets stay on health care. You have, as you have proposed and as the President has commented on tonight, proposed a massive plan to extend health care coverage to children. Youre also talking about the Government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital. And you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the Presidents tax cut on the upper two percent. You heard the President say earlier tonight that its going to cost a whole lot more money than that. I just ask you, where are you going to get the money? Mr. President. Senator. Mr. President. Mr. President, the next question is to you. We all know that Social Security is running out of money, and it has to be fixed. You have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts. But the critics are saying thats going to mean finding a trillion dollars over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up. So where do you get the money? Are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years? Senator Kerry. Let me just stay on Social Security with a new question for Senator Kerry, because Senator Kerry, you have just said you will not cut benefits. Alan Green-span, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, says theres no way that Social Security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate. What hes suggesting, were going to have to cut benefits or were going to have to raise retirement age; we may have to take some other reform. But if youve just said youve promised no changes, does that mean youre just going to leave this as a problem, another problem, for our children to solve? Mr. President. Lets go to a new question, Mr. President. I got more e-mail this week on this question than any other question, and it is about immigration. Im told that at least 8,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. Some people believe this is a security issue, as you know. Some believe its an economic issue. Some see it as a human rights issue. How do you see it, and what do we need to do about it? Times up. Senator. Do you want to respond, Mr. President? Senator. Next question to you, Senator Kerry. The gap between rich and poor is growing wider. More people are dropping into poverty. Yet the minimum wage has been stuck at, what, $5.15 an hour now for about 7 years. Is it time to raise it? Mr. President. Mr. President, I want to go back to something Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a followup of my own. He saidand this will be a new question to youhe said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. So Id ask you directly, would you like to? Senator Kerry, youd like to respond? Thats a new question for President Bush. You have 90 seconds. Yes, sir. Senator. All right, lets go to another question, and it is to Senator Kerry. You have 2 minutes, sir. Senator, at the last debate, President Bush said he did not favor a draft. You agreed with him. But our National Guard and Reserve forces are being severely strained because many of them are being held beyond their enlistments. Some of them say that its a back-door draft. Is there any relief that could be offered to these brave Americans and their families? If you became President, Senator Kerry, what would you do about this situation of holding National Guard and Reservists for these extended periods of time and these repeated callups that theyre now facing? Mr. President. Senator. Mr. President, new question, 2 minutes. You said that if Congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons, that youd sign the legislation. But you did nothing to encourage the Congress to extend it. Why not? Senator. Lets go to a new question. For you, Senator Kerry, 2 minutes. Affirmative actiondo you see a need for affirmative action programs, or have we moved far enough along that we no longer need to use race and gender as a factor in school admissions and Federal and State contracts, and so on? Mr. President. Mr. President, lets go to a new question. You were asked before the invasionor after the invasion of Iraq if you had checked with your dad. And I believeI dont remember the quote exactlybut I believe you said you had checked with a higher authority. I would like to ask you, what part does your faith play on your policy decisions? Senator Kerry. Senator Kerry, after 9/11 and this is a new question for youit seemed to me that the country came together as Ive never seen it come together since World War II. But some of that seems to have melted away. I think its fair to say weve become pretty polarized, perhaps because of the political season. But if you were elected President or whoever is elected President, will you set a priority in trying to bring the Nation back together? Or what would be your attitude on that? Mr. President. Weve come, gentlemen, to our last question. And it occurred to me, as I came to this debate tonight, that the three of us share something. All three of us are surrounded by very strong women. Were all married to strong women. Each of us have two daughters that make us very proud. Id like to ask each of you, what is the most important thing youve learned from these strong women? Senator Kerry. Well, gentlemen, that brings us to the closing statements. Senator Kerry, I believe youre first. Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Senator Kerry. Well, that brings these debates to a close, but the campaign goes on. I want to wish both of you the very best of luck between now and election day. Thats it for us from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. Im Bob Schieffer of CBS News. Good night, everyone.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 8 2004 ,Senator Kerry,President Bush,\"\"\"Yes, I certainly do. [Laughter] But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating. I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening. Mr. President, its good to be with you again this evening, sir. Cheryl, the President didnt find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so hes really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception. And the result is that youve been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that Ive changed a position on this or that or the other. Now, the three things they try to say Ive changed position on are the PATRIOT ActI havent. I support it. I just dont like the way John Ashcroft has applied it. And were going to change a few things. The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things. No Child Left Behind ActI voted for it. I support it. I support the goals. But the President has underfunded it by $28 billion. Right here in St. Louis, youve laid off 350 teachers. Youre 150excuse me, I think its a little moreabout $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here. So I complain about that. Ive argued that we should fully fund it. The President says Ive changed my mind. I havent changed my mind. Im going to fully fund it. So these are the differences. Now, the President has presided over the economy where weve lost 1.6 million jobs, the first President in 72 years to lose jobs. I have a plan to put people back to work. Thats not wishy-washy. Im going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas. The President wants to keep them open. I think Im right. I think hes wrong. Im going to give you a tax cut. The President gavethe top one percent of income earners in America got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together. I think thats wrong. Thats not wishy-washy, and thats what Im fighting foryou. Robin, Im going to answer your question. Im also going to talk respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time. The world is more dangerous today. The world is more dangerous today because the President didnt make the right judgments. Now, the President wishes that I had changed my mind. He wants you to believe that, because he cant come here and tell you that hes created new jobs for America. Hes lost jobs. He cant come here and tell you that hes created health care for Americans because one-pointwhat, weve got 5 million Americans who have lost their health care, 96,000 of them right here in Missouri. He cant come here and tell you that hes left no child behind because he didnt fund No Child Left Behind. So what does he do? Hes trying to attack me. He wants you to believe that I cant be President, and hes trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind. Well, let me tell you straight up, Ive never changed my mind about Iraq. I do believe Saddam Hussein was a threat. I always believed he was a threatbelieved it in 1998 when Clinton was President. I wanted to give Clinton the power to use force if necessary. But I would have used that force wisely. I would have used that authority wisely, not rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. I would have brought our allies to our side. I would have fought to make certain our troops had everybody possible to help them win the mission. This President rushed to war, pushed our allies aside, and Iran now is more dangerous, and so is North Korea with nuclear weapons. He took his eye off the ball, off of Usama bin Laden. The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein. It was to remove the weapons of mass destruction. And Mr. President, just yesterday the Duelfer report told you and the whole world they worked. He didnt have weapons of mass destruction, Mr. President. That was the objective. And if we had used smart diplomacy, we could have saved $200 billion and an invasion of Iraq, and right now Usama bin Laden might be in jail or dead. Thats the war against terror. Anthony, I would not. I have laid out a different plan because the Presidents plan is not working. You see that every night on television. Theres chaos in Iraq. King Abdullah of Jordan said just yesterdayor the day before, you cant hold elections in Iraq with the chaos thats going on today. Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the handling of the reconstruction aid in Iraq by this administration has been incompetent. Those are the Republican chairmans words. Senator Hagel of Nebraska said that the handling of Iraq is beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing. Its in the zone of dangerous. Those are the words of two Republicans, respected, both on the Foreign Relations Committee. Now, I have to tell you, I would do something different. I would reach out to our allies in a way that this President hasnt. He pushed them away time and again, pushed them away at the U.N., pushed them away individually. Two weeks ago, there was a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO. They discussed the possibility of a small training unit or having a total takeover of the training in Iraq. Did our administration push for the total training of Iraq? No. Were they silent? Yes. Was there an effort to bring all the allies together around that? Nobecause theyve always wanted this to be an American effort. You know, they even had the Defense Department issue a memorandum saying dont bother applying for assistance or for being part of the reconstruction if you werent part of our original coalition. Now, thats not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer. Im going to get the training done for our troops. Im going to get the training of Iraqis done faster, and Im going to get our allies back to the table. Yes, sir, please. Ladies and gentlemen, the right war was Usama bin Laden and Afghanistan. That was the right place, and the right time was Tora Bora, when we had him cornered in the mountains. Now, everyone in the world knows that there were no weapons of mass destruction. That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force, not after excuse to get rid of the regime. Now we have to succeed. Ive always said that. I have been consistent. Yes, we have to succeed, and I have a better plan to help us do it. Nikki, thats a question thats been raised by a lot of people around the country. Let me address it but also talk about the weapons the President just talked about, because every part of the Presidents answer just now promises you more of the same over the next 4 years. The President stood right here in this hall 4 years ago, and he was asked a question by somebody just like you: Under what circumstances would you send people to war? And his answer was: With a viable exit strategy and only with enough forces to get the job done. He didnt do that. He broke that promise. We didnt have enough forces. General Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, told him he was going to need several hundred thousand. And guess what? They retired General Shinseki for telling him that. This President hasnt listened. I went to meet with the members of the Security Council in the week before we voted. I went to New York. I talked to all of them to find out how serious they were about really holding Saddam Hussein accountable. I came away convinced that if we worked at it, if we were ready to work at letting Hans Blix do his job and thoroughly go through the inspections, that if push came to shove, theyd be there with us. But the President just arbitrarily brought the hammer down and said, Nope, sorry, time for diplomacy is over. Were going. He rushed to war without a plan to win the peace. Ladies and gentlemen, he gave you a speech and told you hed plan carefully, take every precaution, take our allies with us. He didnt. He broke his word. You rely on good military people to execute the military component of the strategy, but winning the peace is larger than just the military component. General Shinseki had the wisdom to say youre going to need several hundred thousand troops to win the peace. The militarys job is to win the war. The Presidents job is to win the peace. The President did not do what was necessary, didnt bring in enough nations, didnt deliver the help, didnt close off the borders, didnt even guard the ammo dumps. And now our kids are being killed with ammos right out of that dump. Is it Randee? Im sorry. I dont think you can just rely on U.N. sanctions, Randee, but youre absolutely correct. It is a threat. Its a huge threat. And whats interesting is its a threat that has grown while the President has been preoccupied with Iraq, where there wasnt a threat. If hed let the inspectors do their job and go on, we wouldnt have 10 times the numbers of forces in Iraq that we have in Afghanistan chasing Usama bin Laden. Meanwhile, while Iran is moving towards nuclear weaponssome 37 tons of what they call yellow cake, the stuff they use to make enriched uraniumwhile theyre doing that, North Korea has moved from one bomb, maybemaybeto 4 to 7 bombs. For 2 years the President didnt even engage with North Korea, did nothing at all, while it was growing more dangerous, despite the warnings of people like former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who negotiated getting television cameras and inspectors into that reactor. We were safer before President Bush came to office. Now, they have the bombs, and were less safe. So what do we do? Weve got to join with the British and the French, with the Germans whove been involved in their initiative. Weve got to lead the world now to crack down on proliferation as a whole. But the President has been slow to do that even in Russia. At his pace, its going to take 13 years to reduce and get a hold of all the loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. Ive proposed a plan that can capture it and contain it and clean it within 4 years. And the President is moving toward the creation of our own bunker-busting nuclear weapon. Its very hard to get other countries to give up their weapons when youre busy developing a new one. Im going to lead the world in the greatest counterproliferation effort, and if we have to get tough with Iran, believe me, we will get tough. Daniel, I dont support a draft. But let me tell you where the Presidents policies have put us. The President and this is one of the reasons why Im very proud in this race to have the support of General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Admiral William Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Tony McPeak, who ran the air war for the Presidents father and did a brilliant jobsupporting me; General Wes Clark, who won the war in Kosovosupporting me; because they alland General Baca, who was the head of the National Guardsupporting me. Why? Because they understand that our military is overextended under this President. Our Guard and Reserves have been turned into almost active duty. Youve got people doing two and three rotations. Youve got stop-loss policies so people cant get out when they were supposed to. Youve got a backdoor draft right now, and a lot of our military are underpaid. These are families that get hurt. It hurts the middle class. It hurts communities, because these are our first-responders, and theyre called up, and theyre over there, not over here. Now, Im going to add 40,000 active duty forces to the military. And Im going to make people feel good about being safe in our military and not overextended because Im going to run a foreign policy that actually does what President Reagan did and President Eisenhower did and others. Were going to build alliances. Were not going to go unilaterally. Were not going to go alone like this President did. Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining. Eight countries have left it. If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States. Thats not a grand coalition. Ninety percent of the casualties are American. Ninety percent of the costs are coming out of your pockets. I could do a better job. My plan does a better job, and thats why Ill be a better Commander in Chief. Thank you very much, Ann. Ive asked in my security briefings why that is, and I cant go into all the answers, et cetera, but let me say this to you. This President and his administration have told you and all of us, Its not a question of when, its a question ofexcuse me, not a question of if, its a question of when. Weve been told that. The when I cant tell you. Between the World Trade Center bombing inwhat was it, 1993 or soand the next time was 5 years, 7 years. These people wait. Theyll plan. They plot. I agree with the President that we have to go after them and get them wherever they are. I just think I can do that far more effectively because the most important weapon in doing that is intelligence. Youve got to have the best intelligence in the world. And in order to have the best intelligence in the world, to know who the terrorists are and where they are and what theyre plotting, youve got to have the best cooperation youve ever had in the world. Now, to go back to your question, Nikki, were not getting the best cooperation in the world today. Weve got a whole bunch of countries that pay a price for dealing with the United States of America now. Im going to change that. And Im going to put in place a better homeland security effort. Look at it, 95 percent of our containers coming into this country are not inspected today. When you get on an airplane, your cartyour bag is X-rayed, but the cargo hold isnt X-rayed. Do you feel safer? This President, in the last debate, said that, well, that would be a big tax gap if we did that. Ladies and gentlemen, its his tax plan. He chose a tax cut for the wealthiest Americans over getting that equipment out into the homeland as fast as possible. We have bridges and tunnels that arent being secured; chemical plants, nuclear plants that arent secured; hospitals that are overcrowded in their emergency rooms. If we had a disaster today, could they handle it? This President chose a tax cut over homeland security. Wrong choice. Well, the President and his experts have told America that its not a question of if, its a question of when. And I accept what the President has said. These terrorists are serious. Theyre deadly, and they know nothing except trying to kill. I understand that. Thats why I will never stop at anything to hunt down and kill the terrorists. But you heard the President just say to you that weve added money. Folks, the test is not if youve added money. The test is, have you done everything possible to make America secure? He chose a tax cut for wealthy Americans over the things that I listed to you. John, you heard the President just say that he thought he might try to be for it. Four years ago, right here in this forum, he was asked the same question, Cant people be able to import drugs from Canada? Do you know what he said? I think that makes sense. I think thats a good idea4 years ago. Now, the President said, Im not blocking that. Ladies and gentlemen, the President just didnt level with youright now, again. He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate. We sent it over to the House that you could import drugs. We took care of the safety issues. Were not talking about third-world drugs. Were talking about drugs made right here in the United States of America that have American brand names on them, in American bottles, and were asking they be able to allow you to get them. The President blocked it. The President also took Medicare, which belongs to you, and he could have lowered the cost of Medicare and lowered your taxes and lowered the cost to seniors. You know what he did? He made it illegal illegalfor Medicare to do what the VA does, which is bulk-purchase drugs so that you could lower the price and get them out to you lower. He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies, right out of your pockets. Thats the difference between us. The President sides with the power companies, the oil companies, the drug companies. And Im fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and Im fighting to let Medicare survive. Im fighting for the middle class. Thats the difference. Actually, Mr. President, in 1997, we fixed Medicare, and I was one of the people involved in it. We not only fixed Medicare and took it way out into the future, we did something that you dont know how to do. We balanced the budget. And we paid down the debt of our Nation for 2 years in a row, and we created 23 million new jobs at the same time. And its the Presidents fiscal policies that have driven up the biggest deficits in American history. Hes added more debt to the debt of the United States in 4 years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together. Go figure. Very easily. John Edwards is the author of the Patients Bill of Rights. He wanted to give people rights. John Edwards and I support tort reform. We both believe that as lawyersIm a lawyer too and I believe that we will be able to get a fix that has eluded everybody else, because we know how to do it. Its in my health care proposal. Go to johnkerry.comyou can pull it off the Internetand youll find a tort reform plan. Now, ladies and gentlemen, important to understand, the President and his friends try to make a big deal out of it. Is it a problem? Yes, its a problem. Do we need to fix it, particularly for ob-gyns * and for brain surgeons and others? Yes. But its less than one percent of the total cost of health care. Your premiums are going up. Youve gone up in Missouri about $3,500. Youve gone up 64 percent. Youve seen co-pays go up, deductibles go up. Everything has gone up. Five million people have lost their health insurance under this President, and hes done nothing about it. I have a plan. I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you. I have a plan to cover all children. I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care Senators and Congressmen give themselves. I have a plan thats going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare early. And I have a plan that will take the catastrophic cases out of the system, off your backs, pay for it out of a Federal fund, which lowers the premiums for everybody in America, makes American business more competitive, and makes health care more affordable. Now, all of that can happen, but I have to ask you to do one thing. Join me in rolling back the Presidents unaffordable tax cut for people earning more than $200,000 a year. Thats all. Ninety-eight percent of America, Im giving you a tax cut, and Im giving you health care. Yes, I think we should look at the punitive, and we should have some limitations. But look, whats really important, Charlie, is the Presidents just trying to scare everybody here with throwing labels around. I mean, compassionate conservative, what does that mean? Cutting 500,000 kids from after-school programs? Cutting 365,000 kids from health care? Running up the biggest deficits in American history? Mr. President, youre batting 0 for 2. I mean, seriously, labels dont mean anything. What means something is do you have a plan, and I want to talk about my plan some more. I hope we can. Let me begin by saying that my health care plan is not what the President described. It is not a Government takeover. You have choice: Choose your doctor; choose your plan. The Government has nothing to do with it. In fact, it doesnt ask you to do anything. If you dont want to take it, you dont have to. If you like your high premiums, you keep them. Thats the way we leave it. Now, with respect to the deficit, the President was handed a $5.6 trillion surplus, ladies and gentlemen. Thats where he was when he came into office. We now have a $2.6 trillion deficit. This is the biggest turnaround in the history of the country. Hes the first President in 72 years to lose jobs. He talked about war. This is the first time the United States of America has ever had a tax cut when were at war. Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, others knew how to lead. They knew how to ask the American people for the right things. One percent of Americathe highest one percent of income earners in America got $89 billion of tax cut last year. One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down. The President thinks its more important to fight for that top one percent than to fight for fiscal responsibility and to fight for you. I want to put money in your pocket. I amI have a proposal for a tax cut for all people earning less than the $200,000. The only people affected in my plan are the top income earners of America. After 9/11, after the recession had ended, the President asked for another tax cut and promised 5.6 million jobs would be created. He lost 1.6 million, ladies and gentlemen, and most of that tax cut went to the wealthiest people in the country. He came and asked for a tax cut; we wanted a tax cut to kick the economy into gear. Do you know what he presented us with? A $25 billion giveaway to the biggest corporations in America, including a $254 million refund check to Enron. Wrong priorities. You are my priority. Absolutely. Yes. Right into the camerayes. I am not going to raise taxes. I have a tax cut, and heres my tax cut. I raise the child care credit by $1,000 for families to help them be able to take care of their kids. I have a $4,000 tuition tax credit that goes to parents and kids, if theyre earning for themselves, to be able to pay for college. And I lower the cost of health care in the way that I described to you. Every part of my program, Ive shown how Im going to pay for it. And Ive gotten good people, like former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin for instance, who showed how to balance budgets and give you a good economy, to help me crunch these numbers and make them work. Ive even scaled back some of my favorite programs already, like the child care program I wanted to fund and the national service program, because the Presidents deficit keeps growing. And Ive said, as a pledge, Im going to cut the deficit in half in 4 years. Now, Im going to restore what we did in the 1990s, ladies and gentlemen: Pay as you go. Were going to do it like you do it. The President broke the pay-as-you-go rule. Somebody here asked the question about why havent you vetoed something. Its a good question. If you care about it, why dont you veto it? I think John McCain called the energy bill the no lobbyist left behind bill. I mean, youve got to stand up and fight somewhere, folks. Well, first of all, the Presidents figures of 2.2 trillion just arent accurate. Those are the fuzzy math figures put together by some group that works for the campaign. Thats not the number. Number two, John McCain and I have a proposal, jointly, for a commission that closes corporate giveaway loopholes. Weve got $40 billion going to Bermuda. Weve got all kinds of giveaways. We ought to be shutting those down. And third, credible? Ladies and gentlemen, in 1985, I was one of the first Democrats to move to balance the budget. I voted for the balanced budget in 93 and 97. We did it. We did it, and I was there. Boy, to listen to that, the President I dont think is living in a world of reality with respect to the environment. Now, if youre a Red Sox fan, thats okay. But if youre a President, its not. Let me just say to you, number one, dont throw the labels around. Labels dont mean anything. I supported welfare reform. I led the fight to put 100,000 cops on the streets of America. Ive been for faith-based initiatives helping to intervene in the lives of young children for years. I wasbroke with my party in 1985, one of the first three Democrats to fight for a balanced budget when it was heresy. Labels dont fit, ladies and gentlemen. Now, when it comes to the issue of the environment, this is one of the worst administrations in modern history. The Clear Skies bill that he just talked aboutits one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto somethinglike No Child Left Behind, but you leave millions of children behind. Here theyre leaving the skies and the environment behind. If they just left the Clean Air Act all alone the way it is today, no change, the air would be cleaner than it is if you pass the cleaner skies act. Were going backwards. In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what theyre doing to what are called the New Source Performance Standards for air quality. Theyre going backwards on the definition for wetlands. Theyre going backwards on the water quality. They pulled out of the global warming, declared it dead; didnt even accept the science. Im going to be a President who believes in science. The fact is that the Kyoto treaty was flawed. I was in Kyoto, and I was part of that. I know what happened. But this President didnt try to fix it. He just declared it dead, ladies and gentlemen, and we walked away from the work of 160 nations over 10 years. You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people dont like us in some parts of the world. You just say, Hey, we dont agree with you. Goodbye. The President has done nothing to try to fix it. I will. Jane, there are a lot of ways to be competitive. And unfortunately, again, I regret, this administration has not seized them and embraced them. Let me give you an example. Theres a tax loophole right nowif youre a company in St. Louis working, trying to make jobs here, theres actually an incentive for you to go away. You get more moneyyou can keep more of your taxes by going abroad. Im going to shut that loophole, and Im going to give the tax benefit to the companies that stay here in America to help make them more competitive. Secondly, were going to create a manufacturing jobs credit and a new jobs credit for people to be able to help hire and be more competitive here in America. Third, whats really hurting American business, more than anything else, is the cost of health care. Now, you didnt hear any plan from the President, because he doesnt have a plan to lower the cost of health care. Five million Americans have lost their health care; 620,000 Missourians have no health care at all; 96,000 Missourians have lost their health care under President Bush. I have a plan to cover those folks, and its a plan that lowers costs for everybody, covers all children. And the way I pay for itIm not fiscally irresponsibleis I roll back the tax cut that this President so fiercely wants to defend, the one for him and me and Charlie. I think you ought to get the break. I want to lower your cost of health care. I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special needs education. And thats how were going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college. China and India are graduating more graduates in technology and science than we are. Weve got to create the products of the future. Thats why I have a plan for energy independence within 10 years. And were going to put our laboratories and our colleges and universities to work, and were going to get the great entrepreneurial spirit of this country, and were going to free ourselves from this dependency on Mideast oil. Thats how you create jobs and become competitive. You cant stop all outsourcing, Charlie. Ive never promised that. Im not going to, because that would be pandering. You cant. But what you can do is create a fair playing field, and thats what Im talking about. But let me just address what the President just said. Ladies and gentlemen, thats just not true, what he said. The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan. And you know why he gets that count? The President got $84 from a timber company that he owns, and hes counted as a small business. Dick Cheney is counted as a small business. Thats how they do things. Thats just not right. Former Governor Racicot, as chairman of the Republican Party, said he thought that the PATRIOT Act has to be changed and fixed. Congressman Jim Sensenbrennerhes the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has said over his dead body before it gets renewed without being thoroughly rechecked. Whole bunch of folks in America concerned about the way the PATRIOT Act has been applied. In fact, the Inspector General of the Justice Department found that John Ashcroft had twice applied it in ways that were inappropriate. Peoples rights have been abused. I met a man who spent 8 months in prison, wasnt even allowed to call his lawyer, wasnt allowed tofinally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out. This is in our country, folks, the United States of America. Theyve got sneak-and-peak searches that are allowed. Theyve got people allowed to go into churches now and political meetings, without any showing of potential criminal activity or otherwise. Now, I voted for the PATRIOT Act. Ninety-nine United States Senators voted for it. And the President has been very busy running around the country using what I just described to you as a reason to say Im wishy-washy, that Im a flip-flopper. Now, thats not a flip-flop. I believe in the PATRIOT Act. We need the things in it that coordinate the FBI and the CIA. We need to be stronger on terrorism. But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights. You know, Elizabeth, I really respect yourthe feeling thats in your question. I understand it. I know the morality thats prompting that question, and I respect it enormously. But like Nancy Reagan and so many other peopleyou know, I was at a forum with Michael J. Fox the other day in New Hampshire, whos suffering from Parkinsons, and he wants us to do stem cellembryonic stem cell. And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering. His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had, and he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, you know, Dont take away my hope because my hope is what keeps me going. Chris Reeve is a friend of mine. Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again. I think we can save lives. Now, I think we can do ethically guided embryonic stem cell research. We have 100,000 to 200,000 embryos that are frozen in nitrogen today from fertility clinics. These werent taken from abortion or something like that. Theyre from a fertility clinic, and theyre either going to be destroyed or left frozen. And I believe if we have the option, which scientists tell us we do, of curing Parkinsons, curing diabetes, curing some kind of a paraplegic or quadriplegic or a spinal cord injury, anythingthats the nature of the human spirit. I think it is respecting life to reach for that cure. I think it is respecting life to do it in an ethical way. And the Presidents chosen a policy that makes it impossible for our scientists to do that. I want the future, and I think we have to grab it. When you talk about walking a waffle line, he says hes allowed it, which means hes going to allow the destruction of life up to a certain amount, and then he isnt going to allow it. Now, I dont know how you draw that line. But let me tell you pointblank, the lines of stem cells that hes made available, every scientist in the country will tell you, Not adequate, because theyre contaminated by mouse cells and because there arent 60 or 70; there are only about 11 to 20 now, and there arent enough to be able to do the research because theyre contaminated. Weve got to open up the possibilities of this research. And when I am President, Im going to do it, because we have to. Thank you, Charlie. A few years ago, when he came to office, the President saidthese are his words What we need are some good conservative judges on the courts. And he said also that his two favorite Justices are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. So you get a pretty good sense of where hes heading if he were to appoint somebody. Now, heres what I believe. I dont believe we need a good conservative judge, and I dont believe we need a good liberal judge. I dont believe we need a good judge of that kind of definition on either side. I subscribe to the Justice Potter Stewart standard. He was a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States, and he said the mark of a good judge, a good Justice, is that when youre reading their decision, their opinion, you cant tell if its written by a man or a woman, a liberal or a conservative, a Muslim, a Jew, or a Christian. You just know youre reading a good judicial decision. What I want to find, if Im privileged to have the opportunity to do itand the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake in this race, ladies and gentlemen, the future of things that matter to you in terms of civil rights, what kind of Justice Department youll have, whether well enforce the law, will we have equal opportunity, will womens rights be protected, will we have equal pay for women, which is going backwards, will a womans right to choose be protected. These are constitutional rights, and I want to make sure we have judges who interpret the Constitution of the United States according to the law. I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now. First of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. Im a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today. But I cant take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesnt share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I cant do that. But I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife, Teresa, does, about making other choices and about abstinence and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society. But as a President, I have to represent all the people in the Nation, and I have to make that judgment. Now, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro-abortion. But you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you dont deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the Constitution affords them if they cant afford it otherwise. Thats why I think its important. Thats why I think its important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning. Youll help prevent AIDS. Youll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies. Youll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question, and I truly respect it. Well, again, the President just said categorically, My opponent is against this. My opponent is against that. Its just not that simple. No, Im not. Im against the partial-birth abortion, but youve got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother. Secondly, with respect to parental notification, Im not going to require a 16- or 17-year old kid whos been raped by her father and whos pregnant to have to notify her father. So youve got to have a judicial intervention. And because they didnt have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it. Its never quite as simple as the President wants you to believe. I believe the President made a huge mistake, a catastrophic mistake, not to live up to his own standard, which was build a true global coalition, give the inspectors time to finish their job, and go through the U.N. process to its end and go to war as a last resort. I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your gutsgut-check time. Was this really going to war as a last resort? The President rushed our Nation to war without a plan to win the peace, and simple things werent done. Thats why Senator Lugar says incompetent in the delivery of services. Thats why Senator Hagel, Republican, says, beyond pitiful, beyond embarrassing, in the zone of dangerous. We didnt guard 850,000 tons of ammo. That ammo is now being used against our kids. Ten thousand out of twelve thousand Humvees arent armored. Ive visited some of those kids with no limbs today because they didnt have the armor on those vehicles. They didnt have the right body armor. Ive met parents whove, on the Internet, gotten the armor to send their kids. Theres no bigger judgment for a President of the United States than how you take a nation to war. And you cant say, Because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, thats a reason. Thats an excuse. Not necessarily be in power. But heres what Ill say about the 87 billion: I made a mistake in the way I talked about it. He made a mistake in invading Iraq. Which is a worse decision? Now, I voted the way I voted because I saw that he had the policy wrong, and I wanted accountability. I didnt want to give a slush fund to Halliburton. I also thought the wealthiest people in America ought to pay for it, ladies and gentlemen. He wants your kids to pay for it. I wanted us to pay for it, since were at war. I dont think thats a bad decision. You want to go first? Thank you. Charlie, thank you. And thank you all. Thank you, all of you, for taking part; thanks for your questions tonight very, very much. Obviously, the President and I both have very strong convictions. I respect him for that, but we have a very different view about how to make America stronger and safer. I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation. Ill never give a veto of American security to any other entity, not a nation, not a country, not an institution. But I know, as I think you do, that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances. And thats the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it. We are not doing that today. We need to. I have a plan that will help us go out and kill and find the terrorists, and I will not stop in our effort to hunt down and kill the terrorists. But I also have a better plan on how were going to deal with Iraq, training the Iraqi forces more rapidly, getting our allies back to the table with a fresh start, with new credibility, with a President whose judgment the rest of the world trusts. In addition to that, I believe we have a crisis here at home, a crisis of the middle class that is increasingly squeezed, health care costs going up. I have a plan to provide health care to all Americans. I have a plan to provide for our schools so we keep the standards, but we help our teachers teach and elevate our schools by funding No Child Left Behind. I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents. Thats the test. I believe Americas best days are ahead of us. Im an optimist. But we have to make the right choices, to be fiscally responsible and to create the new jobs of the future. We can do this. And I ask you for the privilege of leading our Nation to be stronger at home and respected again in the world. Thank you. \"\"\",\"\"\"Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists. Senator, thank you. I canand thanks, Washington U. as well. I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does. He said he voted for the $87 billion andor voted against it right before he voted for it. And that sends a confusing signal to people. He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat and now said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power. No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does. You know, for a while, he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein. He saw the wisdom, until the Democratic primary came along and Howard Dean, the antiwar candidate, began to gain on him. And he changed positions. I dont see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics. He just brought up the tax cut. You remember, we increased that child credit by $1000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10-percent tax bracket for the lower income Americansthats right at the middle class. He voted against it, and yet he tells you hes for a middle-class tax cut. Itsyouve got to be consistent when youre the President. Theres a lot of pressures, and youve got to be firm and consistent. Each situation is different, Robin. And obviously, we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a President makes is ever to use force. After 9/11, we had to look at the world differently. After 9/11, we had to recognize that when we saw a threat, we must take it seriously before it comes to hurt us. In the old days, wed see a threat, and we could deal with it if we felt like it or not. But 9/11 changed it all. I vowed to our countrymen that I would do everything I could to protect the American people. Thats why were bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy-five percent of them have been brought to justice. Thats why I said to Afghanistan, If you harbor a terrorist, youre just as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban is no longer in power, and Al Qaida no longer has a place to plan. And I saw a unique threat in Saddam Hussein, as did my opponent, because we thought he had weapons of mass destruction. And the unique threat was that he could give weapons of mass destruction to an organization like Al Qaida, and the harm they inflicted on us with airplanes would be multiplied greatly by weapons of mass destruction. And that was a serious, serious threat. So I tried diplomacy. I went to the United Nations. But as we learned in the same report I quoted, Saddam Hussein was gaming the Oil for Food Programme to get rid of sanctions. He was trying to get rid of sanctions for a reason. He wanted to restart his weapons programs. We all thought there was weapons there, Robin. My opponent thought there was weapons there. Thats why he called him a grave threat. I wasnt happy when we found out there wasnt weapons, and weve got an intelligence group together to figure out why. But Saddam Hussein was a unique threat, and the world is better off without him in power. And my opponents plans lead me to conclude that Saddam Hussein would still be in power and the world would be more dangerous. Thank you, sir. Are we going to have a rebuttal thing back and forth? Remember the last debate? My opponent said that America must pass a global test before we use force to protect ourselves. Thats the kind of mindset that says sanctions were working. Thats the kind of mindset that says lets keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well. Saddam Hussein was a threat because he could have given weapons of mass destruction to terrorist enemies. Sanctions were not working. The United Nations was not effective at removing Saddam Hussein. Two days ago in the Oval Office, I met with the Finance Minister from Iraq. He came to see me, and he talked about how optimistic he was and the country was about heading toward elections. Think about it. Theyre going from tyranny to elections. He talked about the reconstruction efforts that are beginning to take hold. He talked about the fact that Iraqis love to be free. He said he was optimistic when he came here. Then he turned on the TV and listened to the political rhetoric, and all of a sudden he was pessimistic. This is a guy who, along with others, has taken great risk for freedom, and we need to stand with him. My opponent says he has a plansounds familiar because its called the Bush plan. Were going to train troops, and we are. Well have 125,000 trained by the end of December. Were spending about $7 billion. He talks about a grand idea: Lets have a summit; were going to solve the problem in Iraq by holding a summit. And what is he going to say to those people that show up to the summit? Join me in the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place? Risk your troops in a war youve called a mistake? Nobody is going to follow somebody who doesnt believe we can succeed and somebody who says the war where we are is a mistake. I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time. I talk to Tony Blair all the time. I talk to Silvio Berlusconi. Theyre not going to follow an American President who says, Follow me into a mistake. Our plan is working. Were going to make elections, and Iraq is going to be free, and America will be better off for it. First of all, we didnt find out he didnt have weapons until we got there, and my opponent thought he had weapons and told everybody he thought he had weapons. And secondly, its a fundamental misunderstanding to say that the war on terror is only Usama bin Laden. The war on terror is to make sure that these terrorist organizations do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. Thats what the war on terror is about. Of course were going to find Usama bin Laden. Weve already got 75 percent of his people, and were on the hunt for him. But this is a global conflict that requires firm resolve. No, I appreciate that. Ilisten, Iweve got a great country. I love our values. And I recognize Ive made some decisions that have caused people to not understand the great values of our country. I remember when Ronald Reagan was the President. He stood on principle. Some might have called that stubborn. He stood on principle, standing up to the Soviet Union. And we won that conflict, yet at the same time, he was verywe were very unpopular in Europe because of decisions he made. I recognize that taking Saddam Hussein out was unpopular, but I made the decision because I thought it was in the right interests of our security. You know, Ive made some decisions on Israel. Thats unpopular. I wouldnt deal with Arafat because I felt like he had let the former President down, and I dont think hes the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state. And people in Europe didnt like that decision. And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do. I believe Palestinians ought to have a state, but I know they need leadership thats committed to democracy and freedom, leadership that will be willing to reject terrorism. I made a decision not to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague, which is where our troops could be brought tobrought in front of a judge, an unaccounted judge. I dont think we ought to join that. That was unpopular. And so what Im telling you is, is that sometimes in this world you make unpopular decisions because you think theyre right. Well continue to reach out. Listen, theres 30 nations involved in Iraq, some 40 nations involved in Afghanistan. People love America. Sometimes they dont like the decisions made by America, but I dont think you want a President who tries to become popular and does the wrong thing. You dont want to join the International Criminal Court just because its popular in certain capitals in Europe. I remember sitting in the White House, looking at those generals, saying, Do you have what you need in this war? Do you have what it takes? I remember going down in the basement of the White House the day we committed our troopsas last resortlooking at Tommy Franks and the generals on the ground, asking them, Do we have the right plan with the right troop level? And they looked me in the eye and said, Yes, sir, Mr. President. Of course I listened to our generals. Thats what a President does. A President sets the strategy and relies upon good military people to execute that strategy. That answer almost made me want to scowl. [Laughter] He keeps talking about letting the inspectors do their job. Its naive and dangerous to say that. Thats what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors. Secondly, of course weve been involved with Iran. I fully understand the threat. And thats why were doing what he suggested we do, get the Brits, the Germans, and the French to go make it very clear to the Iranians that if they expect to be a party to the world, to give up their nuclear ambitions. Weve been doing that. Let me talk about North Korea. It is naive and dangerous to take a policy that he suggested the other day, which is to have bilateral relations with North Korea. Remember, he is the person who is accusing me of not acting multilaterally. He now wants to take the six-party talks we have China, North Korea, South Korea, Russia, Japan, and the United Statesand undermine them by having bilateral talks. Thats what President Clinton did. He had bilateral talks with the North Korean, and guess what happened? He didnt honor the agreement. He was enriching uranium. That is a bad policy. Of course, were paying attention to these. Thats a great question about Iran. Thats why, in my speech to the Congress, I said there is an axis of evil, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and were paying attention to it, and were making progress. Yes, great question. Thanks. I hear theres rumors on the Internets that were going to have a draft. Were not going to have a draftperiod. The All-Volunteer Army works. It works particularly when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure theyve got housing, like we have done in the last military budgets. An all-volunteer army is best suited to fight the new wars of the 21st century, which is to be specialized and to find these people as they hide around the world. We dont need massed armies anymore. One of the things weve done is weve taken thewere beginning to transform our military. And by that I mean were moving troops out of Korea and replacing them with more effective weapons. We dont need as much manpower on the Korean Peninsula to keep a deterrent. In Europe, we have massed troops as if the Soviet Union existed and was going to invade into Europe, but those days are over with. And so were moving troops out of Europe and replacing it with more effective equipment. So the answer to your question is, were withdrawingnot from the worldwere drawing manpower, so they can be stationed here in America, so theres less rotation, so life is easier on their families and therefore more likely to bewell be more likely to keep people in the All-Volunteer Army. One of the most important things were doing in this administration is transformation. Theres some really interesting technologies. For example, were flying unmanned vehicles that can send real-time messages back to stations in the United States. That saves manpower, and it saves equipment. It also means that we can target things easier and move more quickly, which means we need to be lighter and quicker and more facile and highly trained. Forget all this talk about a draft. Were not going to have a draft so long as Im the President. Let me justIve got to answer this. Let me just answer what he just said about going alone. You tell Tony Blair were going alone. Tell Tony Blair were going alone. Tell Silvio Berlusconi were going alone. Tell Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland were going alone. Weve got 30 countries there. It denigrates an alliance to say were going alone, to discount their sacrifices. You cannot lead an alliance if you say youre going alone. And people listen. Theyre sacrificing with us. Thats an odd thing to say since weve tripled the homeland security budget from 10 to 30 billion dollars. Listen, well do everything we can to protect the homeland. My opponent is right: We need good intelligence. Its also a curious thing for him to say, since right after 1993, he voted to cut the intelligence budget by $7.5 billion. The best way to defend America in this world we live in is to stay on the offense. Weve got to be right 100 percent of the time here at home, and theyve got to be right once. And thats the reality. And theres a lot of good people working hard. Were doing the best we possibly can to share information. Thats why the PATRIOT Act was important. The PATRIOT Act is vital, by the way. Its a tool that law enforcement now uses to be able to talk between each other. My opponent says he hasnt changed his positions on it. No, but hes for weakening it. I dont think my opponent has got the right view about the world to make us safe. I really dont. First of all, I dont think he can succeed in Iraq. And if Iraq were to fail, it would be a haven for terrorists, and there would be money, and the world would be much more dangerous. I dont see how you can win in Iraq if you dont believe we should be there in the first place. I dont see how you can lead troops if you say, Its the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. I dont see how the Iraqis are going to have confidence in the American President if all they hear is that it was a mistake to be there in the first place. This war is a long, long war, and it requires steadfast determination. And it requires a complete understanding that we not only chase down Al Qaida, but we disrupt terrorists safe havens as well as people who could provide the terrorists with support. Well, well talk about the tax cut for middle class here in a minute. But yes, Im worried. Im worried. Im worried about our country. And all I can tell you is, every day I know that theres people working overtime, doing the very best they can. And the reason Im worried is because theres a vicious enemy that has an ideology of hate. And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom. Liberty can change habits, and thats whats happening in Afghanistan and Iraq. I havent yet. I just want to make sure theyre safe. When a drug comes in from Canada, I want to make sure it cures you and doesnt kill you. And thats why the FDA and thats why the Surgeon General are looking very carefully to make sure it can be done in a safe way. Ive got an obligation to make sure our Government does everything we can to protect you. And one ofmy worry is that it looks like its from Canada, and it might be from a third world. Weve just got to make sure, before somebody thinks theyre buying a product, that it works. And thats why were doing what were doing. Now, it may very well be, here in December, you hear me say, I think theres a safe way to do it. Other ways to make sure drugs are cheaper: One is to speed up generic drugs to the marketplace quicker. Pharmaceuticals were using loopholes to keep brand drugs in place, and generics are much less expensive than brand drugs. And were doing just that. Another is to get our seniors to sign up for these drug discount cards, and theyre working. Wanda Blackmore, I met here from Missourithe first time she bought drugs with her drug discount card she paid $1.14, I think it was, for about $10 worth of drugs. These cards make sense. And you know, in 2006, seniors are going to get prescription drug coverage for the first time in Medicare, because I went to Washington to fix problems. Medicarethe issue of Medicare used to be called Medi-scare. People didnt want to touch it for fear of getting hurt politically. I wanted to get something done. I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system. And in 2006, our seniors will get prescription drug coverage. Thank you for asking. If theyre safe, theyre coming. I want to remind you that it wasnt just my administration that made the decision on safety. President Clinton did the same thing, because we have an obligation to protect you. Now, he talks about Medicare. Hes been in the United States Senate 20 years. Show me one accomplishment toward Medicare that he accomplished. Ive been in Washington, DC, 3 1/2 years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system. Thats what leadership is all about. Let me see where to start here. First, the National Journal named Senator Kerry * the most liberal Senator of all. And thats saying something in that bunch. You might say that took a lot of hard work. The reason I bring that up is because hes proposed $2.2 trillion in new spending and he says hes going to tax the rich to close the tax gap. He cant. Hes going to tax everybody here to fund his programs. Thats just reality. And what are his health programs? First, he says hes for medical liability reform, particularly for ob-gyns. There was a bill on the floor of the United States Senate that he could have showed up and voted for if hes so much for it. Secondly, he says that medical liability costs only cause one percent increase. That shows a lack of understanding. Doctors practice defensive medicine because of all the frivolous lawsuits that cost our Government $28 billion a year. And finally, he says hes going to have a novel health care plan. You know what it is? The Federal Government is going to run it. It is the largest increase in Federal Government health care ever, and it fits with his philosophy. Thats why I told you about the award he won from the National Journal. Thats what liberals do: They create Government-sponsored health care. Maybe you think that makes sense. I dont. Government-sponsored health care would lead to rationing. It would ruin the quality of health care in America. What does matter is the plan. He said he is foryoure now for capping punitive damages? Thats odd. You should have shown up on the floor in the Senate and voted for it then. Medical liability issues are a problem, a significant problem. Hes been in the United States Senate for 20 years, and he hasnt addressed it. We passed it out of the House of Representatives. Guess where it stuck? It stuck in the Senate because the trial lawyers wont act on it, and he put a trial lawyer on the ticket. Right. Thank you for that. We have a deficit. We have a deficit because this country went into a recession. You might remember the stock market started to decline dramatically 6 months before I came to office, and then the bubble of the 1990s popped. And that cost us rev-enuethat cost us revenue. Secondly, were at war. And Im going to spend what it takes to win the war, more than just 120 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. Weve got to pay our troops more. We have. Weve increased money for ammunition and weapons and pay and homeland security. I just told this lady over here we spentwent from 10 to 30 billion dollars to protect the homeland. I think we have an obligation to spend that kind of money. Plus, we cut taxes for everybody. Everybody got tax relief, so that theyd get out of the recession. I think if you raise taxes during a recession, you head to depression. I come from the school of thought that says when people have more money in their pocket during tough economic times, it increases demand or investment. Small businesses begin to grow, and jobs are added. We found out today that over the past 13 months, weve added 1.9 million new jobs in the last 13 months. I proposed a plan, detailed budget, that shows us cutting the deficit in half by 5 years. And youre right, I havent vetoed any spending bills because we worked together. Non-homeland, non-defense, discretionary spending was rising at 15 percent a year when I got into office. And today, its less than one percent, because were working together to try to bring this deficit under control. Like you, Im concerned about the deficit. But I am not going to shortchange our troops in harms way. And Im not going to run up taxes which will cost this economy jobs. Thank you for your question. Look at the budget. One is, make sure Congress doesnt overspend. But let me talk back about where weve been. The stock market was declining 6 months prior to my arrival. It was the largest stock market correctionone of the largest in history, which foretold a recession. Because we cut taxes on everybody remember, we ran up the child credit by 1,000; we reduced the marriage penalty; we created the 10-percent bracket; everybody who pays taxes got reliefthe recession was one of the shortest in our Nations history. Its just not credible. When he talks about being fiscally conservative, its just not credible. If you look at his record in the Senate, he voted to break the spendingthe caps, the spending caps, over 200 times, and here he says hes going to be a fiscal conservative all of a sudden. Its just not credible. You cannot believe it. And of course hes going to raise your taxes. You see, hes proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending. And so they said, Well, how are you going to pay for it? He said, well, hes going to raise the taxes on the rich. Thats what he said, the top two brackets. That raiseshe says 800 billion; we say 600 billion. Weve got battling green eyeshadessomewhere in between those numbers. And so there is a difference, what hes promised and what he could raise. Now, either hes going to break all these wonderful promises hes told you about, or hes going to raise taxes. And I suspect, given his record, hes going to raise taxes. Is my time up yet? Keep going, good. [Laughter] You looked at me like my clock was up. I think that the way to grow this economy is to keep taxes low, is to have an energy plan, is to have litigation reform. As I told you, we just got a report that said over the past 13 months, weve created 1.9 million new jobs. Were growing. And so the fundamental question of this campaign is, whos going to keep the economy growing so people can work? Thats the fundamental question. Yes, I mean, hes got a record. Hes been there for 20 years. You can run, but you cant hide. He voted 98 times to raise taxes. I mean, these arent make-up figures. And so people are going to have to look at the recordlook at the record of the man running for the President. They dont name him the most liberal in the United States Senate because he hasnt shown up to many meetings. They named him because of his votes, and its reality. Its just not credible to say hes going to keep taxes down and balance budgets. Off-road diesel engineswe have reached an agreement to reduce pollution from off-road diesel engines by 90 percent. Ive got a plan to increase the wetlands by 3 million. Weve got an aggressive brownfield program to refurbish inner-city sore spots to useful pieces of property. I proposed to the United States Congress a Clear Skies Initiative to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury by 70 percent. I wasfought for a very strong title in the farm bill for the Conservation Reserve Program to set aside millions of acres of land forto help improve wildlife in the habitat. We proposed and passed a Healthy Forests bill, which was essential to working withparticularly in western States, to make sure that our forests were protected. What happens in those forests, because of lousy Federal policy, is they grow to be they are nottheyre not harvested. Theyre not taken care of, and as a result, theyre like tinder boxes. And over the last summers Ive flown over there. And so this is a reasonable policy to protect old stands of trees and, at the same time, make sure our forests arent vulnerable to the forest fires that have destroyed acres after acres in the West. Weve got a good, commonsense policy. Now, Im going to tell you what I really think is going to happen over time, is technology is going to change the way we live, for the good, for the environment. So I proposed a hydrogen automobile, a hydrogen-generated automobile. Were spending a billion dollars to come up with the technologies to do that. Thats why Im a big proponent of clean coal technology, to make sure we can use coal but in a clean way. I guess youd say Im a good steward of the land. The quality of the air is cleaner since Ive been the President; fewer water complaints since Ive been the President; more land being restored since Ive been the President. Thank you for your question. Well, had we joined the Kyoto treaty, which I guess hes referring to, it would have cost America a lot of jobs. Its one of these deals where in order to be popular in the halls of Europe, you sign a treaty. But I thought it would cost a lot ofI think theres a better way to do it. And I just told you the facts, sir. The quality of the air is cleaner since Ive been the President of the United States. And well continue to spend money on research and development because I truly believe thats the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that were accustomed to and being able to protect our environment bet-terthe use of technologies. Let me start with how to control the costs of health care: Medical liability reform, for starters, which hes opposed. Secondly, allow small businesses to pool together so they can share risk and buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses get to do. Thirdly, spread whats called health savings accounts. Its good for small businesses, good for owners. You own your own account. You can save tax-free. You get a catastrophic plan to help you own it. This is different from saying, Okay, let me incent you to go on the Government. Hes talking about his plan to keep jobs here. You know, he calls it an outsourcingto keepstop outsourcing. Robert Rubin looked at his plan and said it wont work. The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan. I proposed one to the Congress 2 years ago. It encourages conservation, encourages technology to explore for environmentally friendly ways for coal and use coal and gas. It encourages the use of renewables like ethanol and biodiesel. Its stuck in the Senate. He and his runningmate didnt show up to vote when they could have got it going in the Senate. Less regulations if we want jobs here. Legal reform if we want jobs here. And weve got to keep taxes low. Now, he says hes only going to tax the rich. Do you realize 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income-tax level. And so when youre running up the taxes like that, youre taxing job creators, and thats not how you keep jobs here. I own a timber company? Thats news to me. [Laughter] Need some wood? [Laughter] Most small businesses are Subchapter S corps. They just are. I met Grant Milliron, Mansfield, Ohio. Hes creating jobs. Most small businesses70 percent of the new jobs in America are created by small business. His taxes are going up when you run up the top two brackets. Its a fact. Yes, I appreciate that. I really dont think your rights are being watered down. As a matter of fact, I wouldnt support it if I thought that. Every action being taken against terrorists requires a court order, requires scrutiny. As a matter of fact, the tools now given to the terrorist fighters are the same tools that weve been using against drug dealers and white-collar criminals. So I really dont think so. I hope you dont think that. I mean, Ibecause I think whoever is the President must guard your liberties, must not erode your rights in America. The PATRIOT Act is necessary, for example, because parts of the FBI couldnt talk to each other. Intelligence gathering and the law enforcement arms of the FBI just couldnt share intelligence under the old law, and that didnt make any sense. Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again. Thats the task of the 21st century. And so I dont think the PATRIOT Act abridges your rights at all, and I know its necessary. I can remember being in upstate New York talking to FBI agents that helped bust the Lackawanna cell up there. And they told me they could not have performed their duty, the duty we all expect of them, if they did not have the ability to communicate with each other under the PATRIOT Act. Embryonic stem cell research requires the destruction of life to create a stem cell. Im the first President ever to allow funding, Federal funding, for embryonic stem cell research. I did so because I too hope that well discover cures from the stem cells and from the research derived. But I think weve got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science. And so I made the decision we wouldnt spend any more money beyond the 70 lines, 22 of which are now in action, because science is important but so is ethics, so is balancing life. To destroy life to save life is one of the real ethical dilemmas that we face. There is going to be hundreds of experiments off the 22 lines that now exist, that are active, and hopefully we find a cure. But as well we need to continue to pursue adult stem cell research. I helped double the NIH budget to $28 billion a year to find cures. And the approach I took is one that I think is a balanced and necessary approach, to balance science and the concerns for life. Let me make sure you understand my decision. Those stem cell lines already existed. The embryo had already been destroyed prior to my decision. I had to make the decision: Do we destroy more life; do we continue to destroy life? I made the decision to balance science and ethics. Im not telling. [Laughter] I really dont haveI havent picked anybody yet. Plus, I want them all voting for me. [Laughter] I would pick somebody who would not allow their personal opinion to get in the way of the law. I would pick somebody who would strictly interpret the Constitution of the United States. Let me give you a couple of examples, I guess, of the kind of person I wouldnt pick. I wouldnt pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldnt be said in a school because it had the words under God in it. I think thats an example of a judge allowing personal opinion to enter into the decisionmaking process, as opposed to strict interpretation of the Constitution. And so I would pick people that would be strict constructionists. Weve got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, DC. Legislators make law. Judges interpret the Constitution. And I suspect one of us will have a pick at the end of next yearnext 4 years. And thats the kind of judge Im going to put on thereno litmus test except for how they interpret the Constitution. Trying to decipher that. [Laughter] My answer is were not going to spend Federal taxpayers money on abortion. This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America. I signed the ban on partial-birth abortion. Its a brutal practice. Its one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban. I think there ought to be parental notification laws. Hes against them. I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. In other words, if youre a mom and youre pregnant, you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that. These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life. I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion. And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done. Culture of life is really important for a country to have if its going to be a hospitable society. Thank you. Its pretty simple when they say, Are you for a ban on partial-birth abortion? Yes or no. And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no. And thats just the way it is. Thats a vote. It came right up. Its clear for everybody to see. And as I said, you can run, but you cant hide. Its the reality. Put a head fake on. I have made a lot of decisions, some of them little, like appointments to a board youve never heard of, and some of them big. And in a war, theres a lot of tactical decisions that historians will look back and say, You shouldnt have done that. You shouldnt have made that decision. And Ill take responsibility for them. Im human. But on the big questions about whether or not we should have gone into Afghanistan, the big question about whether we should have removed somebody in Iraq, Ill stand by those decisions because I think theyre right. Thats really what youre when they ask about the mistakes, thats what theyre talking about. Theyre trying to say, Did you make a mistake going into Iraq? And the answer is absolutely not. It was the right decision. The Duelfer report confirmed that decision today, because what Saddam Hussein was doing was trying to get rid of sanctions so he could reconstitute a weapons program, and the biggest threat facing America is terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. We knew he hated us. We knew he had been ainvaded other countries. We knew he tortured his own people. On the tax cut, its a big decision. I did the right decision. Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history. Now, you ask what mistakesI made some mistakes in appointing people, but Im not going to name them. I dont want to hurt their feelings on national TV. But history will look back, and Im fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration. Because the President makes the decisions, the President has to take the responsibility. He complains about the fact our troops dont have adequate equipment, yet he voted against the $87 billion supplemental I sent to the Congress and then issued one of the most amazing quotes in political history: I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it. Saddam Hussein was a risk to our country, maam. And he was a risk thatand this is where we just have a difference of opinion. The truth of the matter is, if you listen carefully: Saddam would still be in power if he were the President of the United States, and the world would be a lot better off. Go ahead. Actually Either way. [Laughter] Charlie, thanks. Thank you all very much. Its been enjoyable. The great contest for the Presidency is about the future, who can lead, who can get things done. Weve been through a lot together as a country, been through a recession, corporate scandals, war. And yet, think about where we are. We added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months. The farm income in America is high. Small businesses are flourishing. Homeownership rate is at an alltime high in America. Were on the move. Tonight I had a chance to discuss with you what to do to keep this economy going: Keep the taxes low, dont increase the scope of the Federal Government, keep regulations down, legal reform, a health care policy that does not empower the Federal Government but empowers individuals, and an energy plan that will help us become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. And abroad, were at war, and it requires a President who is steadfast and strong and determined. I vowed to the American people after that fateful day of September the 11th that we would not rest nor tire until were safe. The 9/11 Commission put out a report that said America is safer, but not yet safe. Theres more work to be done. Well stay on the hunt on Al Qaida. Well deny sanctuary to these terrorists. Well make sure they do not end up with weapons of mass destruction. The great nexus, the great threat to our country is that these haters end up with weapons of mass destruction. But our long-term security depends on our deep faith in liberty. Well continue to promote freedom around the world. Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow Afghanistan will be voting for a President. In Iraq, well be having free elections, and a free society will make this world more peaceful. God bless. \"\"\",\"\"\"Tonights format is going to be a bit different. We have assembled a townhall meeting. Were in the Show Me State, as everyone knows Missouri to be, so Missouri residents will ask the questions, these 140 citizens who were identified by the Gallup Organization as not yet committed in this election. Now, earlier today each audience member gave me two questions on cards like this: One theyd like to ask of the President; the other theyd like to ask the Senator. I have selected the questions to be asked and the order. No one has seen the final list of questions but mecertainly not the candidates. No audience member knows if he or she will be called upon. Audience microphones will be turned off after a question is asked. Audience members will address their question to a specific candidate. Hell have 2 minutes to answer. The other candidate will have a minute and a half for rebuttal. And I have the option of extending discussion for 1 minute, to be divided equally between the two men. All subjects are open for discussion. And you probably know the light system by now, green light at 30 seconds, yellow at 15, red at 5, and flashing red means youre done. Those are the candidates rules. I will hold the candidates to the time limits forcefully, but politely, I hope. And now please join me in welcoming, with great respect, President Bush and Senator Kerry. Gentlemen, to the business at hand. The first question is for Senator Kerry, and it will come from Cheryl Otis, who is right behind me. Mr. President, a minute and a half. Mr. President, I would follow up, but we have a series of questions on Iraq, and so I will turn to the next questioner. The question for President Bush, and the questioner is Robin Dahle. Can you get a microphone, Robin, Im sorry. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. Mr. President, I do want to follow up on this one, because there were several questions from the audience along this line. Well, I was going to have you do it with the rebuttal. But you go ahead. [Laughter] Youre up. Senator? Were going to have another question now on the subject of Iraq. And Im just going to turn to Anthony Baldi with a question for Senator Kerry. Mr. Baldi. Do you want to follow up, Senator? The next question is for President Bush, and it comes from Nikki Washington. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. Mr. President. Senator. The next question is for Senator Kerry, and it comes from over here, from Randee Jacobs. Youll need a microphone. Mr. President, a minute and a half. Were going to move on, Mr. President, with a question for you. And it comes from Daniel Farley. Mr. Farley. Senator Kerry, minute and a half. Mr. President, lets extend for a minute. Exactly. And with Reservists being held on duty and some soldiers I wanted to get into the issue of the backdoor draft. Senator. The next question, Senator Kerry, is for you, and it comes from Ann Bronsing, who I believe is over in this area. Mr. President. I want to extend for a minute, Senator, and Im curious about something you said. You said, Its not when but if. You think its inevitable? Because the sense of security is a very basic thing with everybody in this country, worried about their kids. Mr. President. Mr. President, were going to turn to questions now on domestic policy, and were going to start with health issues. And the first question is for President Bush, and its from John Horstman. Senator, a minute and a half. Mr. President. Next question is for Senator Kerry, and this comes from Norma-Jean Laurent. Mr. President, a minute and a half. Senator Kerry, we got several questions along this line, and Im just curious if youd go further on what you talked about with tort reform. Would you be favoring capping awards on pain and suffering? Would you limit attorneys fees yes, to follow up on this for a minute. Thirty seconds. Well get to that in just a minute. Thirty seconds. The next question is for President Bush, and it comes from Matthew OBrien. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. I bothI heard you both sayI have heard you both say during the campaign, and I just heard you say it that youre going to cut the deficit by a half in 4 years. But I didnt hear one thing in the last 3 1/2 minutes that would indicate how either one of you do that. Senator Kerry, 30 seconds. Senator Kerry, the next question will be for you, and it comes from James Varner, who I believe is in this section. Mr. Varner? You need a microphone. Mr. President, 90 seconds. No, you can keep going. Youre on Im going to come back one more time to how these numbers add up and how you can cut that deficit in half in 4 years, given what youve both said. Thirty secondsIm sorry, thirty seconds, Mr. President. Mr. President, the next question is for you, and it comes from James Hubb, over here. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. Mr. President? Senator Kerry, 30 seconds. Senator Kerry, the next question is for you. It involves jobs, which is a topic in the news today. And for the question, were going to turn to Jane Barrow. Mr. President, minute and a half. Senator, I want to extend for a minute. You talk about tax credits to stop outsourcing. But when you have IBM documents that I saw recently, where you can hire a programmer for $12 in China, $56 an hour here, tax credits wont cut it in that area. President Bush, the next question is for you, and it comes from Rob Fowler, who I believe is over in this area. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. Senator Kerry, the next question is for you, and it comes from Elizabeth Long. Mr. President, a minute and a half. Senator, thirty seconds, lets extend. Mr. President. Mr. President, the next question is for you, and it comes from Jonathan Michaelson. Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. Going to go to the final two questions, now. And the first one will be for Senator Kerry, and this comes from Sarah Degenhart. Mr. President, a minute and a half. Senator, do you want to follow up? Thirty seconds. And 30 seconds, Mr. President. And the final question of the evening will be addressed to President Bush, and it will come from Linda Grabel. Linda Grabel is over here. I got faked out, myself. [Laughter] Senator Kerry, a minute and a half. Mr. President. And Senator Kerry, 30 seconds. Thats going to conclude the questioning. Were going to go now to closing statements, 2 minutes from each candidate. And the first closing statement goes to Senator Kerry. I believe that was the agreement. Senator. And a closing statement from President Bush. Mr. President and Senator Kerry. That concludes tonights debate. I want to give you a reminder that the third and final debate, on issues of domestic policy, will be held next Wednesday, October 13th, at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, hosted by Bob Schieffer of CBS News. I want to thank President Bush and Senator Kerry for tonight. I want to thank these citizens of the St. Louis area who asked the questions, who gave so willingly of their time, and who took their responsibility very seriously. Thank you also to everyone at Washington. I want to thank everyone at Washington University in St. Louis for being such gracious hosts. Im Charles Gibson from ABC News. From St. Louis, good night.\"\"\"\n",
      "September 30 2004 ,Senator Kerry,President Bush,\"\"\"Yes, I do. But before I answer further, let me thank you for moderating. I want to thank the University of Miami for hosting us. And I know the President will join me in welcoming all of Florida to this debate. Youve been through the roughest weeks anybody could imagine. Our hearts go out to you, and we admire your pluck and perseverance. I can make America safer than President Bush has made us. And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally, but we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe. I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and when we are leading strong alliances. Ill never give a veto to any country over our security, but I also know how to lead those alliances. This President has left them in shatters across the globe, and were now 90 percent of the casualties in Iraq and 90 percent of the costs. I think thats wrong, and I think we can do better. I have a better plan for homeland security. I have a better plan to be able to fight the war on terror: by strengthening our military; strengthening our intelligence; by going after the financing more authoritatively; by doing what we need to do to rebuild the alliances; by reaching out to the Muslim world, which the President has almost not done; and beginning to isolate the radical Islamic Muslims, not have them isolate the United States of America. I know I can do a better job in Iraq, where I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this President has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table. We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves. And I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections. All of these, and especially homeland security, which well talk about a little bit later. I believe in being strong and resolute and determined, and I will hunt down and kill the terrorists, wherever they are. But we also have to be smart, Jim, and smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Usama bin Laden and taking it off to Iraq, where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein. This President has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment. And judgment is what we look for in the President of the United States of America. Im proud that important military figures are supporting me in this race: former Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili; just yesterday General Eisenhowers son, General John Eisenhower, endorsed me; GeneralAdmiral William Crowe; General Tony McPeak, who ran the Air Force war so effectively for his father. All believe I would make a stronger Commander in Chief. And they believe it because they know I would not take my eye off of the goal, Usama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora. We had him surrounded. But we didnt use American forces, the best trained in the world, to go kill him. The President relied on Afghan warlords that he outsourced that job to. Thats wrong. Well, where do you want me to begin? [Laughter] First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections. In fact, he first didnt even want to do that, and it wasnt until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said, Youve got to go to the U.N., that the President finally changed his mind his campaign has a word for thatand went to the United Nations. Now, once there, we could have continued those inspections. We had Saddam Hussein trapped. He also promised America that he would go to war as a last resort. Those words mean something to me, as somebody who has been in combat, last resort. Youve got to be able to look in the eyes of families and say to those parents, I tried to do everything in my power to prevent the loss of your son and daughter. I dont believe the United States did that, and we pushed our allies aside. And so today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the cost, $200 billion$200 billion that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and its in Iraq. And Iraq is not even the center of the focus of the war on terror. The center is Afghanistan where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before, where the opium production is 75 percent of the worlds opium production, where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium, where the elections have been postponed 3 times. The President moved the troops, so hes got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Usama bin Laden is. Does that mean that Saddam Hussein was 10 times more important than Usama bin Laden excuse meSaddam Hussein more important than Usama bin Laden? I dont think so. The President just talked about Iraq as a center of the war on terror. Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the President invaded it. The President made the judgment to divert forces from under General Tommy Franks from Afghanistan before the Congress even approved it, to begin to prepare to go to war in Iraq. And he rushed to war in Iraq without a plan to win the peace. Now, that is not the judgment that a President of the United States ought to make. You dont take America to war unless you have a plan to win the peace. You dont send troops to war without the body armor that they need. Ive met kids in Ohio, parents in Wisconsin, placesIowa, where theyre going out on the Internet to get the state-of-the-art body gear to send to their kidssome of them have got them for a birthday present. I think thats wrong. Humvees10,000 out of 12,000 Humvees that are over there arent armored. And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they dont have the armament. This President justI dont know if he sees whats really happening out there, but its getting worse by the daymore soldiers killed in June than before, more in July than June, more in August than July, more in September than in August. And now we see beheadings, and weve got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and theyre blowing people up. And we dont have enough troops there. Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am. And I will succeed for those troops, now that were there. We have to succeed. We cant leave a failed Iraq. But that doesnt mean it wasnt a mistake of judgment to go there and take the focus off of Usama bin Laden. It was. Now, we can succeed, but I dont believe this President can. I think we need a President who has the credibility to bring the allies back to the table and to do whats necessary to make it so America isnt doing this alone. Jim, let me tell you exactly what Ill do, and there are a long list of things. First of all, what kind of mixed message does it send when youve got $500 million going over to Iraq to put police officers in the streets of Iraq and the President is cutting the COPS program in America? What kind of message does it send to be sending money to open firehouses in Iraq, but were shutting firehouses, who are the first-responders, here in America? The President hasnt put one nickel not one nickelinto the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems. Thats why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there. We hadnt done the work that ought to be done. The President95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected. Civilians get onto aircraft, and theirtheir luggage is X-rayed, but the cargo hold is not X-rayed. Does that make you feel safer in America? This President thought it was more important to give the wealthiest people in America a tax cut rather than invest in homeland security. Those arent my values. I believe in protecting America first. And long before President Bush and I get a tax cutand thats who gets itlong before we do, Im going to invest in homeland security, and Im going to make sure were not cutting COPS programs in America, and were fully staffed at our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants. The President also, unfortunately, gave in to the chemical industry, which didnt want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure. And theres an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists. Thats a whole other subject, butI see we still have a little bit more time. Let me just quickly say, at the current pace the President will not secure the loose material in the Soviet Unionformer Soviet Union for 13 years. Im going to do it in 4 years. And were going to keep it out of the hands of terrorists. The President just said the FBI had changed its culture. We just read on the front pages of Americas papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes unlistened to. On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time. And the test is not whether youre spending more money. The test is, are you doing everything possible to make America safe? We didnt need that tax cut. America needed to be safe. Thank you, Jim. My message to the troops is also Thank you for what theyre doing, but its also, Help is on the way. I believe those troops deserve better than what they are getting today. You know, its interesting, when I was in the ropeline just the other day coming out here from Wisconsin, a couple of young returnees were in the line, one active duty, one from the Guard. And they both looked at me and said, We need you. Youve got to help us over there. Now, I believe theres a better way to do this. You know, the Presidents father did not go into Iraqinto Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didnt is, he saidhe wrote in his book, because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. Thats exactly where we find ourselves today. Theres a sense of American occupation. The only building that was guarded when the troops went into Baghdad was the oil ministry. We didnt guard the nuclear facilities. We didnt guard the foreign office, where you might have found information about weapons of mass destruction. We didnt guard the borders. Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions. I know what its like to go out on one of those missions where you dont know whats around the corner. And I believe our troops need other allies helping. Im going to hold that summit. I will bring fresh credibility, a new start, and we will get the job done right. Lets change the rules. We can add a whole[inaudible]. Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war. But the President made a mistake in invading Iraq. Which is worse? I believe that when you know somethings going wrong, you make it right. Thats what I learned in Vietnam. When I came back from that war, I saw that it was wrong. Some people dont like the fact that I stood up to say no, but I did. And thats what I did with that vote. And Im going to lead those troops to victory. No, and they dont have to, providing we have the leadership that we putthat Im offering. I believe that we have to win this. The President and I have always agreed on that. And from the beginning, I did vote to give the authority because I thought Saddam Hussein was a threat. And I did accept thatthat intelligence. But I also laid out a very strict series of things we needed to do in order to proceed from the position of strength, and the President, in fact, promised them. He went to Cincinnati, and he gave a speech in which he said, We will plan carefully. We will proceed cautiously. We will not make war inevitable. We will go with our allies. He didnt do any of those things. They didnt do the planning. They left the planning of the State Department on the State Department desks. They avoided even the advice of their own general. General Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff, said, Youre going to need several hundred thousand troops. Instead of listening to him, they retired him. The terrorism czar, who has worked for every President since Ronald Reagan, said, Invading Iraq in response to 9/11 would be like Franklin Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor. Thats what we have here. And what we need now is a President who understands how to bring these other countries together to recognize their stakes in this. They do have stakes in it. Theyve always had stakes in it. The Arab countries have a stake in not having a civil war. The European countries have a stake in not having total disorder on their doorstep. But this President hasnt even held the kind of statesmanlike summits that pull people together and get them to invest in those stakes. In fact, hes done the opposite; he pushed them away. When the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, offered the United Nations, he said, No, no, well go do this alone. To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, If you werent with us in the war, dont bother applying for any construction. Thats not a way to invite people. The United Nations Kofi Annan offered help after Baghdad fell. And we never picked him up on that and did what was necessary to transfer authority and to transfer reconstruction. It was always American-run. Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries, Great Britain, Australia, and the United States. Thats not a grand coalition. We can do better. What I think troubles a lot of people in our country is that the President has just sort of described one kind of mistake, but what he has said is that even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection of Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way. Those are his words. Now, I would not. So what Im trying to do is just talk the truth to the American people and to the world. Truth is what good policy is based on. Its what leadership is based on. The President says that Im denigrating these troops. I have nothing but respect for the British and for Tony Blair and for what theyve been willing to do. But you cant tell me that when the most troops any other country has on the ground is Great Britain with 8,300, and below that, the 4 others are below 4,000, and below that, there isnt anybody out of the hundreds, that we have a genuine coalition to get this job done. You cant tell me that on the day that we went into that war and it started, it was principally the United States, theAmerica and Great Britain and one or two others; thats it. And today we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs. And meanwhile, North Korea has gotten nuclear weapons. Talk about mixed messages, the President is the one who said we cant allow countries to get nuclear weapons. They have. Ill change that. Well, Ive never, ever used the harshest word, as you did just then, and I try not to. Ive beenbut Ill, nevertheless, tell you that I think he has not been candid with the American people, and Ill tell you exactly how. First of all, we all know that in his State of the Union Message he told Congress about nuclear materials that didnt exist. We know that he promised America that he was going to build this coalition. I just described the coalition. It is not the kind of coalition we were described when we were talking about voting for this. The President said he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through that full process. He didnt. He cut it off, sort of arbitrarily. And we know that there were further diplomaticsefforts underway. They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards. Now, he misled the American people in his speech when he said, We will plan carefully. They obviously didnt. He misled the American people when he said, Wed go to war as a last resort. We did not go as a last resort. And most Americans know the difference. Now, this has cost us deeply in the world. I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people. Ive worked with those leaders the President talks about. Ive worked with them for 20 years, for longer than this President, and I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table. And I believe that fresh start, new credibility, a President who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world, to make it clear that this is not you know, Usama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say theAmerica has declared war on Islam. We need to be smarter about how we wage a war on terror. We need to deny them the recruits. We need to deny them the safe havens. We need to rebuild our alliances. I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and others did that more effectively, and Im going to try to follow in their footsteps. I wasnt misleading when I said he was a threat. Nor was I misleading on the day that the President decided to go to war when I said that he had made a mistake in not building strong alliances and that I would have preferred that he did more diplomacy. Ive had one position, one consistent position, that Sad-dam Hussein was a threat; there was a right way to disarm him and a wrong way. And the President chose the wrong way. I understand what the President is talking about, because I know what it means to lose people in combat. And the question, is it worth the cost, reminds me of my own thinking when I came back from fighting in that war, and it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors. That happened before. And thats one of the reasons why I believe I can get this job done, because I am determined, for those soldiers and for those families, for those kids who put their lives on the linethat is noble. Thats the most noble thing that anybody can do. And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility. Now, we have a choice here. Ive laid out a plan by which I think we can be successful in Iraq, with a summit, by doing better training faster, by cuttingby doing what we need to do with respect to the U.N. and the elections. Theres only 25 percent of the people in there. They cant have an election right now. The President is not getting the job done. So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that Ive laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about, or you can go to johnkerry.com and see more of it, or you have the Presidents plan, which is four words, More of the same. I think my plan is better. And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops. I will never let those troops down and will hunt and kill the terrorists, wherever they are. Secretary of State Colin Powell told this President the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you fix it. Now, if you break it, you made a mistake. Its the wrong thing to do, but you own it. And then youve got to fix it and do something with it. Now, thats what we have to do. Theres no inconsistency. Soldiers know, over there, that this isnt being done right yet. Im going to get it right for those soldiers, because its important to Israel. Its important to America. Its important to the world. Its important to the fight on terror. But I have a plan to do it. He doesnt. The timeline that Ive set outand again, I want to correct the President, because hes misled again this evening on what Ive said. I didnt say I would bring troops out in 6 months. I said, If we do the things that Ive set out, and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in 6 months. And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesnt have long-term designs on it. As I understand it, were building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say theyve got a rather permanent concept to them. When youwhen you guard the oil ministry but you dont guard the nuclear facilities, the message to a lot of people is, Maybewell, maybe theyre interested in our oil. Now, the problem is that they didnt think these things through properly, and these are the things you have to think through. What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground. And you have to do that by beginning to not back off of Fallujahs and other places and send the wrong message to the terrorists. You have to close the borders. Youve got to show youre serious in that regard. But youve also got to show that youre prepared to bring the rest of the world in and share the stakes. I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq. And our goal, in my administration, would be to get all of the troops out of there, with the minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace. But thats how were going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves. Even the administration has admitted they havent done the training, because they came to Congress a few weeks ago and asked for a complete reprogramming of the money. Now, what greater admission is there, 16 months afterwards, Oops, we havent done the job. Weve got to start to spend the money now. Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training? I couldnt agree more that the Iraqis want to be free and that they could be free. But I think the President, again, still hasnt shown how hes going to go about it the right way. He has more of the same. Now, Prime Minister Allawi came here, and he said the terrorists are pouring over the border. Thats Allawis assessment. The national intelligence assessment that was given to the President in July said: Best case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst case scenario, civil war. I can do better. Jim, the President just said something extraordinarily revealing and, frankly, very important in this debate. In answer to your question about Iraq and sending people into Iraq, he just said, The enemy attacked us. Saddam Hussein didnt attack us. Usama bin Laden attacked us. Al Qaida attacked us. And when we had Usama bin Laden cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, 1,000 of his cohorts with him in those mountains, with the American military forces nearby and in the field, we didnt use the best trained troops in the world to go kill the worlds number one criminal and terrorist. They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other. Thats the enemy that attacked us. Thats the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains. Thats the enemy that is now in 60 countries with stronger recruits. He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger. That is just factually incorrect. Two-thirds of the country was a no-fly zone when we started this war. We would have had sanctions. We would have had the U.N. inspectors. Saddam Hussein would have been continually weakening. If the President had shown the patience to go through another round of resolution, to sit down with those leaders and say, What do you need? What do you need now? How much more will it take to get you to join us, we would be in a stronger place today. Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the President invaded than Saddam Hussein. And while he has been diverted with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Koreas got nuclear weapons, and the world is more dangerous. Iran is moving towards nuclear weapons, and the world is more dangerous. Darfur has a genocide. The world is more dangerous. Id have made a better choice. The President always has the right and always has had the right for preemptive strike. That was a great doctrine throughout the cold war, and it was always one of the things we argued about with respect to arms control. No President, through all of American history, has ever ceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any way necessary to protect the United States of America. But if and when you do it, Jim, youve got to do in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test, where your countrymen, your people, understand fully why youre doing what youre doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons. Here we have our own Secretary of State whos had to apologize to the world for the presentation he made to the United Nations. I mean, we can remember when President Kennedy, in the Cuban missile crisis, sent his Secretary of State to Paris to meet with de Gaulle, and in the middle of the discussion to tell them about the missiles in Cuba, he said, Here, let me show you the photos. And de Gaulle waved them off and said, No, no, no, no. The word of the President of the United States is good enough for me. How many leaders in the world today would respond to us, as a result of what weve done, in that way? So what is at test here is the credibility of the United States of America and how we lead the world. Iran and Iraq are now moreIran and North Korea are now more dangerous. Now, whether preemption is ultimately what has to happen or not, I dont know yet. But Ill tell you this, as President, Ill never take my eye off that ball. Ive been fighting for proliferation the entire timeantiproliferation the entire time Ive been in the Congress. And weve watched this President actually turn away from some of the treaties that were on the table. You dont help yourself with other nations when you turn away from the global warming treaty, for instance, or when you refuse to deal at length with the United Nations. You have to earn that respect. And I think we have a lot of earning back to do. With respect to Iran, the British, French, and Germans were the ones who initiated an effortwithout the United States, regrettablyto begin to try to move to deter the nuclear possibilities in Iran. I believe we could have done better. I think the United States should have offered the opportunity to provide the nuclear fuel, test them to see whether or not they were actually looking for it for peaceful purposes. If they werent willing to work a deal, then we could have put sanctions together. The President did nothing. With respect to North Korea, the real story, we had inspectors and television cameras in the nuclear reactor in North Korea. Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton. And we knew where the fuel rods were, and we knew the limits on their nuclear power. Colin Powell, our Secretary of State, announced one day that we were going to continue the dialog and work with the North Koreans. The President reversed him publicly, while the President of South Korea was here. And the President of South Korea went back to South Korea bewildered and embarrassed because it went against his policy. And for 2 years, this administration didnt talk at all to North Korea. While they didnt talk at all, the fuel rods came out. The inspectors were kicked out. The television cameras were kicked out. And, today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea. That happened on this Presidents watch. Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious sort of reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send. Both. I want bilateral talks which put all of the issues from the Armistice of 1952, the economic issues, the human rights issues, the artillery disposal issues, the DMZ issues, and the nuclear issues on the table. Well, Ill tell you exactly why not, but I first want to say something about those sanctions on Iran. Only the United States put the sanctions on, alone, and thats exactly what Im talking about. In order for the sanctions to be effective we should have been working with the British, French, and Germans and other countries. And thats the difference between the President and me. And there again, he sort of slid by the question. Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that were not saying send American troops in at this point is several-fold. Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now, all the President is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. Theyve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing, and thats going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it isone of the reasons we cant do it is were overextended. Ask the people in the Armed Forces today. Weve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. Weve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today, people with stop-loss programs where theyre told, You cant get out of the military, 9 out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming, or preparing. So this is the way the President has overextended the United States. Thats why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of Special Forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect to fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. But Ill tell you this, as President, if it took American forces, to some degree, to coalesce the African Union, Id be prepared to do it, because we could never allow another Rwanda. Its a moral responsibility for us in the world. Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the President just made, and I share them with him. I think only if youveif youre doing this, and hes done it more than I have in terms of the Presidency, can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families. And its tough. And so I acknowledge his daughters. Ive watched them. Ive chuckled a few times at some of their comments. [Laughter] And Well, I know, Ive learned not to do that. [Laughter] And I have great respect and admiration for his wife. I think shes a terrific person and a great First Lady. But we do have differences. Im not going to talk about a difference of character. I dont think thats my job or my business. But let me talk about something that the President just sort of finished up withmaybe someone would call it a character trait; maybe somebody wouldntbut this issue of certainty. Its one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong. Its another to be certain and be right, or be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right. What I worry about with the President is that hes not acknowledging whats on the ground. Hes not acknowledging the realities of North Korea. Hes not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem cell research or of global warming and other issues. And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble. I have no intention of wilting. Ive never wilted in my life, and Ive never wavered in my life. I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq and my position has been consistent. Saddam Hussein is a threat. He needed to be disarmed. We needed to go to the U.N. The President needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something because he never did it without the threat of force, but we didnt need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace. Nuclear proliferation nuclear proliferation. There are some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union, in Russia. At the rate that the President is currently securing that, it will take 13 years to get it. I did a lot of work on this. I wrote a book about it several years agomaybe 6 or 7 years ago, called The New War, which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network. And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it, and the black market sale price was about $250 million. Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today. And this President, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last 2 years since 9/11 than we did in the 2 years preceding 9/11. We have to do this job. And to do the job, you cant cut the money for it. The President actually cut the money for it. You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership. And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea. Right now the President is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons. The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons. It doesnt make sense. You talk about mixed messages. Were telling other people, You cant have nuclear weapons, but were pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using. Not this President. Im going to shut that program down, and were going to make it clear to the world were serious about containing nuclear proliferation. And were going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in 4 years. And were going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation. This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Its our generations equivalent, and I intend to get it done. Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation. But again, the test of the difference between usthe President has had 4 years to try to do something about it, and North Korea has got more weapons. Iran is moving towards weapons. And at his pace, it will take 13 years to secure those weapons in Russia. Im going to do it in 4 years, and Im going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea. Well, let me just say quickly that Ive had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation, and I was probably one of the first Senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former Senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them. And it sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make. I regret whats happened in these past months, and I think it goes beyond just the response to terror. Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations. His political opposition is being put in jail. And I think its very important for the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good. This is a very important country to us, and we want a partnership. But we always have to stand up for democracy. As George Will said the other day, Freedom on the march, not in Russia right now. Now, Id like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks, because thats one of the most critical issues here, North Korea. Just because the President says it cant be done, that youd lose China, doesnt mean it cant be done. I mean, this is the President who said there were weapons of mass destruction, said mission accomplished, said we could fight the war on the cheap, none of which were true. We can have bilateral talks with Kim Chong-il, and we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China, because China has an interest in the outcome too. It was a threat. Thats not the issue. The issue is what you do about it. The President said he was going to build a true coalition, exhaust the remedies of the U.N., and go to war as a last resort. Those words really have to mean something. And unfortunately, he didnt go to war as a last resort. Now we have this incredible mess in Iraq, $200 billionits its not what the American people thought they were getting when they voted. Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you very much to the university again. Thank you, Mr. President. My fellow Americans, as I said at the very beginning of this debate, both President Bush and I love this country very much. There is no doubt, I think, about that. But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world. I know that for many of you sitting at home, parents of kids in Iraq, you want to know, who is the person who could be a Commander in Chief who can get your kids home and get the job done and win the peace? And for all the rest of the parents in America who are wondering about their kids going to a school or anywhere else in the world, what kind of world theyre going to grow up in, let me look you in the eye and say to you: Ive defended this country as a young man in war, and I will defend it as President of the United States. But I have a difference with this President. I believe were strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances. I have a plan for Iraq. I believe we can be successful. Im not talking about leaving. Im talking about winning. And we need a fresh start, a new credibility, a President who can bring allies to our side. I also have a plan to win the war on terror, funding homeland security, strengthening our military, cutting off finances, reaching out to the worldagain, building strong alliances. I believe Americas best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear. Thats the country that Im going to fight for, and I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud. I ask you to give me the opportunity to lead this great Nation so that we can be stronger here at home, respected again in the world, and have responsible leadership that we deserve. Thank you, and God bless America. \"\"\",\"\"\"I too thank the University of Miami and say our prayers are with the good people of this State whove suffered a lot. September the 11th changed how America must look at the world. And since that day, our Nation has been on a multipronged strategy to keep our country safer. Weve pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide; 75 percent of known Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice. The rest of them know were after them. Weve upheld the doctrine that said, If you harbor a terrorist, youre equally as guilty as the terrorist. And the Taliban, no longer in power; 10 million people have registered to vote in Afghanistan in the upcoming Presidential election. In Iraq, we saw a threat, and we realized that after September the 11th, we must take threats seriously before they fully materialize. Saddam Hussein now sits in a prison cell. America and the world are safer for it. We continue to pursue our policy of disrupting those who proliferate weapons of mass destruction. Libya has disarmed. The A.Q. Khan network has been brought to justice. And as well, were pursuing a strategy ofof freedom around the world, because I understand free nations will reject terror; free nations will answer the hopes and aspirations of their people; free nations will help us achieve the peace we all want. No, I dont believe its going to happen. I believe Im going to win because the American people know I know how to lead. Ive shown the American people I know how to lead. I haveI understand everybody in this country doesnt agree with the decisions that Ive made, and I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand. People out there listening know what I believe, and thats how best it is to keep the peace. This Nation of ours has got a solemn duty to defeat this ideology of hate, and thats what they are. This is a group of killers who will not only kill here but kill children in Russia, that will attack unmercifully in Iraq hoping to shake our will. We have a duty to defeat this enemy. We have a duty to protect our children and grandchildren. The best way to defeat them is to never waver, to be strong, to use every asset at our disposal, is to constantly stay on the offensive, and at the same time, spread liberty. And thats what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan. Ten million citizens have registered to vote. Its a phenomenal statistic, that if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls. Forty-one percent of those 10 million are women. In Iraq, no doubt about it, its tough. Its hard work. Its incredibly hard. You know why? Because an enemy realizes the stakes. The enemy understands a free Iraq will be a major defeat in their ideology of hatred. Thats why theyre fighting so vociferously. They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there because they tried to beat us, and they didnt. And theyre showing up in Iraq for the same reason. Theyre trying to defeat us. And if we lose our will, we lose. But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy. My opponent looked at the same intelligence I looked at and declared, in 2002, that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat. He also said, in December of 2003, that anyone who doubts that the world is safer without Saddam Hussein does not have the judgment to be President. I agree with him. The world is better off without Saddam Hussein. I was hoping diplomacy would work. I understand the serious consequences of committing our troops into harms way. Its the hardest decision a President makes. So I went to the United Nations. I didnt need anybody to tell me to go to the United Nations; I decided to go there myself. And I went there hoping that, once and for all, the free world would act in concert to get Saddam Hussein to listen to our demands. And they passed a resolution that said, Disclose, disarm, or face serious consequences. I believe when an international body speaks, it must mean what it says. But Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. Why should he? He had 16 other resolutions, and nothing took place. As a matter of factmy opponent talks about inspectorsthe facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors. That wasnt going to work. Thats kind of a pre-September-10th mentality, to hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place. He was hoping wed turn away. But there was, fortunately, others beside myself who believed that we ought to take action, and we did. The world is safer without Saddam Hussein. Jim, weve got the capability of doing both. As a matter of fact, this is a global effort. Were facing a a group of folks who have such hatred in their heart, theyll strike anywhere with any means. And thats why its essential that we have strong alliances, and we do. Thats why its essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are. But to say that theres only one focus on the war on terror doesnt really understand the nature of the war on terror. Of course were after Saddam Hussein I mean, bin Laden. Heshes isolated. Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice. The killer inthe mastermind of the September the 11th attacks, Khalid Sheik Mohammad, is in prison. Were making progress, but the front on this war is more than just one place. The Philippinesweve got helpwere helping them there to bringto bring Al Qaida affiliates to justice there. And of course Iraq is a central part of the war on terror. Thats why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us. Their hope is that we grow weary and we leave. The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq. We will succeed. Weve got a plan to do so, and the main reason well succeed is because the Iraqis want to be free. I had the honor of visiting with Prime Minister Allawi. Hes a strong, courageous leader. He believes in the freedom of the Iraqi people. He doesnt want U.S. leadership, however, to send mixed signals, to not stand with the Iraqi people. He believes, like I believe, that the Iraqis are ready to fight for their own freedom. They just need the help to be trained. There will be elections in January. Were spending reconstruction money. And our alliance is strong. Thats the plan for victory. And when Iraq is free, America will be more secure. Can I respond? Thank you, sir. First of all, what my opponent wants you to forget is that he voted to authorize the use of force and now says, Its the wrong war at the wrong time at the wrong place. I dont see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place. What message does that send our troops? What message does that send our allies? What message does that send the Iraqis? No, the way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved and to follow through on the plan that Ive just outlined. I dont think we want to get to how hes going to pay for all these promises. Its like a huge tax gap andanyway, thats for another debate. My administration has tripled the amount of money were spending on homeland security, to $30 billion a year. My administration worked with the Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security so we could better coordinate our borders and ports. Weve got 1,000 extra Border Patrol on the southern border, more than 1,000 on the northern border. Were modernizing our borders. Weve spent $3.1 billion for fire and police$3.1 billion. Were doing our duty to provide the funding. But the best way to protect this homeland is to stay on the offense. We have to be right 100 percent of the time, and the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us. Theres a lot of good people working hard. And by the way, weve also changed the culture of the FBI to have counterterrorism as its number one priority. Were communicating better. Were going to reform our intelligence services to make sure that we get the best intelligence possible. The PATRIOT Act is vital. Its vital that the Congress renew the PATRIOT Act, which enables our law enforcement to disrupt terrorist cells. But again, I repeat to my fellow citizens, the best way to protect you is to stay on the offense. Of course were doing everything we can to protect America. I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America. Thats my job. I work with Director Mueller of the FBI. He comes into my office, when Im in Washington, every morning talking about how to protect us. Theres a lot of really good people working hard to do so. Its hard work. But again, I want to tell the American people, were doing everything we can at home, but you better have a President who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again. Let me first tell you that the best way for Iraq to be safe and secure is for Iraqi citizens to be trained to do the job. And thats what were doing. We got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, over 200,000 by the end of next year. That is the best way. Well never succeed in Iraq if the Iraqi citizens do not want to take matters into their own hands and protect themselves. I believe they want to. Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to. And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops homewhich I really want to do, but I dont want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because weve achieved an objectiveis to see the Iraqis perform, is to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility. And so the answer to your question is, when our generals on the ground and Ambassador Negroponte tells me that Iraq is ready to defend herself from these terrorists, that elections will have been held by then, that theres stability, and that theyre on their way toyou know, a nation of thats free. Thats when. And I hope its as soon as possible. But I know putting artificial deadlines wont work. My opponent one time said, Well, get me elected, Ill have them out of there in 6 months. Thatsyou cant do that and expect to win the war on terror. My message to our troops is: Thank you for what youre doing; were standing with you strong; well give you all the equipment you need; and well get you home as soon as the missions done, because this is a vital mission. A free Iraq will be a ally in the war on terror, and thats essential. A free Iraq will set a powerful example in the part of the world that is desperate for freedom. A free Iraq will help secure Israel. A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran. A free Iraq is essential for the security of this country. Jim I think its worthy for a followup if you dont mind. All right. My opponent says, Help is on the way, but what kind of message does it say to our troops in harms way, wrong war, wrong place, wrong time? Thats not a message a Commander in Chief givesor This is a great diversion. As well, help is on the way, but its certainly hard to tell it when he voted against the $87 billion supplemental to provide equipment for our troops and then said he actually did vote for it before he voted against it. Thats not what Commander in Chiefs does when youre trying to lead troops. Thats totally absurd. Of course the U.N. was invited in, and we support the U.N. efforts there. They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed, but theyre now back in, helping with elections. My opponent says we didnt have any allies in this war? Whats he say to Tony Blair? Whats he say to Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland? I mean, you cant expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq. Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve. So whats the message going to be? Please join us in Iraq for a grand diversion? Join us for a war that is a wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time? I know how these people think. I deal with them all the time. I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently. Theyre not going to follow somebody who says this is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time. Theyre not going to follow somebody whose core convictions keep changing because of politics in America. And finally, he says we ought to have a summit. Well, there are summits being held. Japan is going to have a summit for the donors. Theres $14 billion pledged, and Prime Minister Koizumi is going to call countries to account to get them to contribute. And theres going to be an Arab summit of the neighborhood countries, and Colin Powell helped set up that summit. Well, actually, he forgot Poland. And now, there are 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops, and I honor their sacrifices. And I dont appreciate it when a candidate for President denigrates the contributions of these bravebrave soldiers. Itsyou cannot lead the world if you do not honor the contributions of those who are with us. He called them the coerced and the bribed. Thats not how you bring people together. Our coalition is strong. It will remain strong, for myso long as Im the President. No, what I said was that because we achieved such a rapid victory, more of the Saddam loyalists were around. In other words, we thought wed whip more of them going in. But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared. I thought we wouldthey would stay and fight, but they didnt. And now were fighting them now. Itsand its hard work. I understand how hard it is. I get the casualty reports every day. I see on the TV screens how hard it is, but its necessary work. And Im optimistic. See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time. Im optimistic well achieveI know we wont achieve if we send mixed signals. I know were not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens. Weve got a plan in place. The plan says therell be elections in January, and there will be. The plan says well train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are. And its not only just America, but NATO is now helping. Jordan is helping train police. The UAE is helping train police. Weve allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts, and were making progress there. And our alliance is strong. Now, I just told you, theres going to be a summit of the Arab nations. Japan will be hosting a summit. Were making progress. It is hard work. It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy. Its hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off or executed, to a place where people are free. But its necessary work, and a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place. My opponent just said something amazing. He said Usama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America. Usama bin Laden isnt going to determine how we defend ourselves. Usama bin Laden doesnt get to decide. The American people decide. I decided. The right action was in Iraq. My opponent calls it a mistake. It wasnt a mistake. He said I misled on Iraq. I dont think he was misleading when he called Iraq a grave threat in the fall of 2002. I dont think he was misleading when he said that it was right to disarm Iraq in the spring of 2003. I dont think he misled you when he said that ifanyone who doubted whether the world was better off without Saddam Hussein in power didnt have the judgment to be President. I dont think he was misleading. I think what is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war, and he has. As the politics change, his positions change, and thats not how a Commander in Chief acts. Ilet me finish. The intelligence I looked at was the same intelligence my opponent looked at, the very same intelligence. And when I stood up there and spoke to the Congress, I was speaking off the same intelligence he looked at to make his decisions to support the authorization of force. The only thing consistent about my opponents position is that hes been inconsistent. He changes positions. And you cannot change positions in this war on terror if you expect to win. And I expect to win. Its necessary we win. Were being challenged like never before, and we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction. No, every life is precious. Every life matters. You know, my hardestthe hardest part of the job is to know that I committed the troops in harms way and then do the best I can to provide comfort for the loved ones who lost a son or a daughter or a husband and wife. And you know, I think about Missy Johnson, who is a fantastic young lady I met in Charlotte, North Carolina, she and her son, Bryan. They came to see me. Her husband, P.J., got killed. Hed been in Afghanistan, went to Iraq. You know, its hard work to try to love her as best as I can, knowing full well that the decision I made caused her loved one to be in harms way. I told her, after we prayed and teared up and laughed some, that I thought her husbands sacrifice was noble and worthy, because I understand the stakes of this war on terror. I understand that we must find Al Qaida wherever they hide. We must deal with threats before they fully materialize and Saddam Hussein was a threatand that we must spread liberty, because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom. Missy understood that. Thats what she told me her husband understood. So you say, was it worth it? Every life is precious. Thats what distinguishes us from the enemy. Everybody matters. But I think its worth it, Jim. I think its worth it because I thinkI know in the long term, a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan will set such a powerful example in the part of the world thats desperate for freedom it will help change the worldthat we can look back and say, We did our duty. I understand what it means to be the Commander in Chief, and if I were to ever say this is the wrong war at the wrong time at the rightwrong place, the troops would wonder, How can I follow this guy? You cannot lead the war on terror if you keep changing positions on the war on terror and say things like, Well, this is just a grand diversion. Its not a grand diversion. This is an essential, that we get it right. And so Ithe plan he talks about simply wont work. Theres 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol. Theres going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year. Yes, were getting the job done. Its hard work. Everybody knows its hard work because theres a determined enemy thats trying to defeat us. Now, my opponent says hes going to try to change the dynamics on the ground. Well, Prime Minister Allawi was here. He is the leader of that country. Hes a brave, brave man. When he came, after giving a speech to the Congress, my opponent questioned his credibility. You cant change the dynamics on the ground if youve criticized the brave leader of Iraq. One of his campaign people alleged that Prime Minister Allawi was like a puppet. Thats no way to treat somebody whos courageous and brave, that is trying to lead his country forward. The way to make sure that we succeed is to send consistent, sound messages to the Iraqi people that when we give our word, we will keep our word; that we stand with you; that we believe you want to be free. And I do. I believe that the 25 million people, the vast majority, long to have elections. I reject this notionand Im not suggesting that my opponent says it, but I reject the notion that some say that if youre Muslim you cant be free; you dont desire freedom. I disagree, strongly disagree with that. Yes, let me The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said theyre coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror. Theyre fighting us because theyre fighting freedom. They understand that a free Afghanistan or a free Iraq will be a major defeat for them, and those are the stakes. And thats why it is essential we not leave. Thats why its essential we hold the line. Thats why its essential we win, and we will. Under my leadership, were going to win this war in Iraq. I would hope I never have to. I understand how hard it is to commit troops. I never wanted to commit troops. I neverwhen I was running when we had the debate in 2000, I never dreamt I would be doing that. But the enemy attacked us, Jim, and I have a solemn duty to protect the American people, to do everything I can to protect us. I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely well ever have to use troops. But a President must always be willing to use troops. It mustas a last resort. TheI was hopeful diplomacy would work in Iraq. It was falling apart. There was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein was hoping that the world would turn a blind eye. And if he had been in powerin other words, we had said, Lets let the inspectors work, or Lets hope to talk him out; maybe an 18th resolution would work, hed have been stronger and tougher, and the world would have been a lot worse off. Theres just no doubt in my mind. We would rue the day if Saddam Hussein had been in power. So we use diplomacy every chance we get, believe me. And II would hope never to have to use force. But by speaking clearly and sending messages that we mean what we say, weve affected the world in a positive way. Look at Libya. Libya was a threat. Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs. Libya understood that America and others will enforce doctrine, and the world is better for it. So to answer your question, I would hope wed never have to. I think by acting firmly and decisively, it will mean its less likely toless likely we have to use force. First, listen of course I know Usama bin Laden attacked us. I know that. And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose is ludicrous, in my judgment. It just shows a significant difference of opinion. We tried diplomacy. We did our best. He was hoping to turn a blind eye, and, yes, he would have been stronger had we not dealt with him. He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons. Let meIm not exactly sure what you mean, passes the global test. You take preemptive action if you pass a global test? My attitude is you take preemptive action in order to protect the American people, that you act in order to make this country secure. My opponent talks about me not signing certain treaties. But let me tell you one thing I didnt signand I think it shows a difference of our opinion, the difference of opinionsand that is that I wouldnt join the International Criminal Court. This is a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors could pull our troops, our diplomats up for trial. And I wouldnt join it. And I understand that in certain capitals around the world that that wasnt a popular move. But its the right move, not to join a foreign court that couldwhere our people could be prosecuted. My opponent is for joining the International Criminal Court. I just think trying to be popular kind of in the global sense, if its not in our best interest, makes no sense. Im interested in working with other nations and do a lot of it. But Im not going to make decisions that I think are wrong for America. North Korea, firstI do. Let me say I certainly hope so. Before I was sworn in, the policy of this Government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea. And we signed an agreement with North Korea that my administration found out that was not being honored by the North Koreans. And so I decided that a better way to approach the issue was to get other nations involved, justbesides us. And in Crawford, Texas, Jiang Zemin and I agreed that the nuclear-weapons-free NorthpeninsulaKorean Peninsula was in his interest and our interest and the worlds interest. And so we began a new dialog with North Korea, one that included not only the United States but now China. And China has got a lot of influence over North Korea, in some ways more than we do. As well we included South Korea, Japan, and Russia. So now there are five voices speaking to Kim Chong-il, not just one. And so if Kim Chong-il decides again to not honor an agreement, hes not only doing injustice to America, hed be doing injustice to China as well. And I think this will work. Its not going to work if we open up a dialog with Kim Chong-il. Thats what he wants. He wants to unravel the six-party talksor the fivethe five-nation coalition thats sending him a clear message. On Iran, I hope we can do the same thing, continue to work with the world to convince the Iranian mullahs to abandon their nuclear ambitions. Weve worked very closely with the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, and Great Britain, who have been the folks delivering the message to the mullahs that if you expect to be part of the world of nations, get rid of your nuclear programs. The IAEA is involved. Theres a special protocol recently been passed that allows for instant inspections. I hope we can do it, and weve got a good strategy. Right. The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind. Its exactly what Kim Chong-il wants. And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not to plutonium. The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium. Thats what we caught him doing. Thats where he was breaking the agreement. Secondly, you saidmy opponent said that hed work to put sanctions on Iran. Weve already sanctioned Iran. We cant sanction them anymore. There are sanctions in place on Iran. And finally, we were a party to the convincingto working with Germany, France, and Great Britain to send their Foreign Ministers into Iran. Back to Iran, just for a second. It was not my administration that put the sanctions on Iran. That happened long before I arrived in Washington, DC. In terms of Darfur, I agree, its genocide, and Colin Powell so stated. We have committed $200 million worth of aid. Were the leading donor in the world to help the suffering people there. We will commit more, over time, to help. We were very much involved at the U.N. on the sanction policy of the Bashir Government in the Sudan. Prior to Darfur, Ambassador Jack Danforth had been negotiating a north-south agreement that we would hope would have brought peace to the Sudan. I agree with my opponent that we shouldnt be committing troops, that we ought to be working with the African Union to do soprecisely what we did in Liberia. We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out. My hope is that the African Union moves rapidly to help save lives. Fortunately, the rainy season will be ending shortly, which will make it easier to get aid there and help the long-suffering people there. Whew, thats a loaded question. [Laughter] First of all, I admire Senator Kerrys service to our country. I admire the fact that he is a great dad. I appreciate the fact that his daughters have been so kind to my daughters in what has been a pretty hard experience for, I guess, young girls seeing their dads out there campaigning. I admire the fact that hes served for 20 years in the Senate, although Im not so sure I admire the record. I wont hold it against him that he went to Yale. Nothing wrong with that. Imy concerns about the Senator is that in the course of this campaign Ive been listening very carefully to what he says, and he changed his positions on the war in Iraq, changed his positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq. You cannot lead if you send mixed messages. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies. Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens. And thats my biggest concern about my opponent. I admire his service. But I just know how this world works and that in the councils of government, there must be certainty from the U.S. President. Of course, we change tactics when need to, but we never change our beliefs, the strategic beliefs that are necessary to protect this country in the world. Im trying to put a leash on them. [Laughter] Thank you. Well, I thinklisten, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will in Iraq. Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed. But what I wont do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure. And it isone of the things Ive learned in the White House is that theres enormous pressure on the President, and you cannot wilt under that pressure. Otherwise the world wont be better off. Actually, weve increased funding for dealing with nuclear proliferation about 35 percent since Ive been the President. Secondly, weve set up whats called thewell, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network. And thats why weve put proliferation as theone of the centerpieces of a multipronged strategy to make the country safer. My administration started what is called the Proliferation Security Initiative, over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials. And were been effective. We busted the A.Q. Khan network. This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya. We convinced Libya to disarm. It was an essential part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation. Ill tell you another way to help protect America in the longin the long run is continue with missile defenses, and weve got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration. Well be implementing a missile defense system relatively quickly. And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century. My opponent is opposed to the missile defenses. In the hands of a terrorist enemy. Again, I cant tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea. Its precisely what Kim Chong-il wants. It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate. It means that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Chong-il to get rid of his weapons. Its a big mistake to do that. We must have Chinas leverage on Kim Chong-il, besides ourselves. And if you enter bilateral talks, theyll be happy to walk away from the table. I dont think that will work. No, I dont think its okay and said so publicly. I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy and made that very clearthat by consolidating power in a central government, hes sending a signal to the Western world and the United States thatthat perhaps he doesnt believe in checks and balances. And Ive told him that. Hes also a strong ally in the war on terror. He islisten, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan where these terrorists gunned down young school kids. But its the nature of the enemy, by the way. Thats why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice. Its precisely what Vladimir Putin understands as well. Ive got a good relation with Vladimir, and its important that we do have a good relation because that enables me to better comment to him and tobetter to discuss with him some of the decisions he makes. I found that in this world that its important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, youre able to disagree in a way that is effective. And so Ive told him my opinion. I look forward to discussing it more with him as time goes on. Russia is a country in transition. Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices, and I think its very important for the American President as well as other Western leaders to remind him of the great benefits of democracy, that democracy will best help the people realize their hopes and aspirations and dreams. And I will continue working with him over the next 4 years. You know my opinion on North Korea. I cant say it any more plainly. Pardon me? Oh, Im a pretty calm guy. [Laughter] I mean, I dont take it personally. But you know, look, we looked at the same intelligence. We came to the same conclusion, that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat. And I dont hold it against him that he said grave threat. Im not going to go around the country saying he didnt tell the truth, when he looked at the same intelligence I did. Thank you very much, tonight, Jim. Thank you, Senator. If America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. Thats not going to happen so long as Im your President. In the next 4 years, we will continue to strengthen our homeland defenses. We will strengthen our intelligence gathering services. We will reform our military. The military will be an all-volunteer army. We will continue to stay on the offense. We will fight the terrorists around the world so we do not have to face them here at home. Well continue to build our alliances. Ill never turn over Americas national security needs to leaders of other countries as we continue to build those alliances. And well continue to spread freedom. I believe in the transformational power of liberty. I believe that a free Iraq is in this Nations interests. I believe a free Afghanistan is in this Nations interests, and I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East. Weve done a lot of hard work together over the last 3 1/2 years. Weve been challenged, and weve risen to those challenges. Weve climbed the mighty mountain. I see the valley below, and its a valley of peace. By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want. I appreciate your listening tonight. I ask for your vote. And may God continue to bless our great land. \"\"\",\"\"\"These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonights will last 90 minutes, following detailed rules of engagement worked out by representatives of the candidates. I have agreed to enforce their rules on them.

New question, Senator Kerry, 2 minutes.

You mentioned Darfur, the Darfur region of Sudan. Fifty thousand people have already died in that area, more than a million are homeless, and its been labeled an act of ongoing genocide.

For now, thank you, Senator Kerry, President Bush. From Coral Gables, Florida, Im Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 17 2000 ,AL GORE,GEORGE BUSH,\"\"\" Im glad you clarified that. Mr. Hankins, I dont feel good about it, and I think we ought to have a patients bill of rights to take the medical decisions away from the HMOs and give them back to the doctors and nurses. I want to come back and tell you why, but if you will forgive me, I would like to say something right now at the beginning of this debate following on the moment of silence for Mel Carnahan and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford. Tipper and I were good friends with Mel and Randy, and I know that all of us here want to extend our sympathy and condolences to Jean and the family and to the Sifford family. And I would just like to say that this debate in a way is a living tribute to Mel Carnahan because he loved the vigorous discussion of ideas in our democracy. He was a fantastic governor of Missouri. This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership. One of the best in advancing all kinds of benefits for children to grow up healthy and strong. And of course, this debate also takes place at a time when the tragedy of the USS Cole is on our minds and hearts and insofar as the memorial services tomorrow, I would like to also extend sympathy to the families of those who have died and those who are still missing, and the injured. Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand. Doctors are giving prescriptions, theyre recommending treatments, and then their recommendations are being overruled by HMOs and insurance companies. That is unacceptable. I support a strong national patients bill of rights. It is actually a disagreement between us, a national law that is pending on this, the Dingle-Norwood bill, a bipartisan bill, is one that I support and that the governor does not. Jim, we have a direct disagreement on this. Absolutely not. I referred to the Dingle-Norwood bill. It is the bipartisan bill that is now pending in the Congress. The HMOs and the insurance companies support the other bill thats pending, the one that the Republican majority has put forward. They like it because it doesnt accomplish what I think really needs to be accomplished to give the decisions back to the doctors and nurses and give you a right of appeal to somebody other than the HMO or insurance company, let you go to the nearest emergency room without having to call an HMO before you call 911, to let you see a specialist if you need to, and it has strong bipartisan support. It is being blocked by the Republican leadership in the Congress.MODERATOR: Sir. And I specifically would like to know whether Governor Bush will support the Dingle-Norwood bill, which is the main one pending. What about the Dingle-Norwood bill? All right, here we go again. Now look, if you want someone who will spend a lot of words describing a whole convoluted process and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man. If you want someone who will fight for you and who will fight for the middle-class families and working men and women, who are sick and tired of having their parents and grandparents pay higher prices for prescription drugs than anybody else, then I want to fight them. And you asked a great question because its not only seniors. Listen, for 24 years I have never been afraid to take on the big drug companies. They do some great things. They discover great new cures and thats great. We want them to continue that. But they are now spending more money on advertising and promotion. You see all these ads? Than they are on research and development. And they are trying artificially extend the monopoly patent protection so they can keep charging these very high prices. I want to streamline the approval of the competing generic drugs and the new kinds of treatments that can compete with them so we bring the price down for everybody. Now, briefly, let me tell you how my prescription drug plan works. The governor talked about Medicare. I propose a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare for all seniors, all seniors, and heres how it works. You pick your own doctor, and nobody can take that away from you. The doctor chooses the prescription that you need and nobody can overrule your doctor. You go to your own pharmacy and then Medicare pays half the price. If youre poor, they pay all of it. If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket. And Ill bring new competition to bring the price down. And if you pass the big drug companies bill, nothing will happen. I think that we should move step-by-step toward universal health coverage, but I am not in favor of government doing it all. Weve spent 65 years now on the development of a hybrid system, partly private, partly public, and 85% of our people have health insurance, 15% dont. That adds up to 44 million people. That is a national outrage. We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and weve got to improve the quality for those who do with a patients bill of rights thats real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because thats been left out. We have got to deal with long-term care. Now, here are the steps that I would take, first of all. I will make a commitment to bring health care coverage of high quality that is affordable to every single child in America within four years. And then well fill other gaps by covering the parents of those children when the family is poor or up to two and a half times the poverty rate. I want to give a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance plans. I want to give small business employers a tax credit, 25%, to encourage the providing of health insurance for the employees in small businesses. I want to give seniors who are, well, the near elderly, I dont like that term because I am just about in that category, but those 55 to 65 ought to be able to buy into Medicare for premiums that are reasonable and fair and significantly below what they have to get now. Now, we have a big difference on this. And you need to know the record here. Under Governor Bush, Texas has sunk to be 50th out of 50 in health care -- in health insurance for their citizens. Last week he said that they were spending 3.7 billion dollars, or 4.7 billion dollars on this.MODERATOR: Mr. Vice president.GORE: Okay. We have huge difference between us on this question. Id like to start by telling you what my vision is. I see a day in the United States of America where all of our public schools are considered excellent, world class. Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student. Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools. It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years. It means also helping local school districts that sometimes find the parents of school age children outvoted on bond issues, to give them some help with interest-free bonding authority so that we can build new schools and modernize the classrooms. We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills. I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college. I want to work for universal free school because we know from all the studies that the youngsters learn, kids learn more in the first few years of life than any where else. Now, I said there was a contrast. Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves. And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldnt even pay the full tuition to private school. I think thats a mistake. I dont think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools. I think we -- I think we should make it the number one priority to make our schools the best in the world, all of them. Well, the program that hes proposing is not the one that he just. Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up. Now, youre -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money. Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what theyre doing. Its based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great. If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently. But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools. We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are. What grade do you teach? High school. I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues. Traditionally, if youve been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote. Its ironic that there are now -- there is now a smaller percentage of the voters made up of parents with children than ever in American history because of the aging of our population, but at the same time weve got the largest generation of students in public schools ever. More than 90% of Americas children go to public schools. And its the largest number ever this year and theyll break the record next year and every year for ten years running. Weve got to do something about this. And local -- its not enough to leave it up to the local school districts. Theyre not able to do it and our future depends upon it. Look, were in an information age. Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college. And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers. My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where theyre most needed. Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability. My plan requires testing of all students. It also requires something that Governor Bushs plan doesnt. It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach. We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, two minutes. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Im so glad that I have the chance to knock that down. Look, the problem is that under Governor Bushs plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined. Now under my plan well balance the budget every year. Im not just saying this. Im not just talking. I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt. And under my plan, in four years, as the percentage of our gross domestic product, federal spending will be the smallest that it has been in 50 years. One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt? We get nothing for it. We keep the good faith and credit of the United States. I will pay down the debt every single year until it is eliminated early in the next decade. That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy. Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else. That was in an ad, Jim, that was knocked down by the journalists who analyzed the ad and said it was misleading.BUSH: My turn?MODERATOR: Yes, sir. Can we take the time -- Yeah, look. Look, this isnt about Governor Bush, its not about me. It is about you. And I want to come back to something I said before. If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man. If you want somebody who will fight for you and who will fight to have middle-class tax cuts, then I am your man. I want to be. Now, I doubt anybody here makes more than $330,000 a year. I wont ask you, but if you do, youre in the top 1%. Im not going to ask them. But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%. Now you judge for yourselves whether or not thats fair. Hey, Ive got to answer that, Jim.MODERATOR: All right. Medicare -- I cast the tie-breaking vote to add 26 years to the life of Medicare. It was due to go bankrupt in 1999 and that 50 million figure again, the newspapers -- I said -- you said forget the journalists, but they are the keepers of the score card and whether or not youre using facts that arent right. And that fact is just not right. I see a future when the world is at peace, with the United States of America promoting the values of democracy and human rights and freedom all around the world. Even in Iran they have had an election that began to bring about some change. We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them. Right now our military is the strongest in the entire history of the world. I will -- I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way. Now, what can I bring to that challenge? When I was a young man, my father was a senator opposed to the Vietnam War. When I graduated from college, there were plenty of fancy ways to get out of going and being a part of that. I went and I volunteered, and I went to Vietnam. I didnt do the most or run the greatest risk by a long shot, but I learned what it was like to be an enlisted man in the United States Army. In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction. Look, were gonna face some serious new challenges in the next four years. Ive worked on that long and hard. When I went to the United States Senate, I asked for an assignment to the Armed Services Committee. And while I was there I worked on a bipartisan basis, as I did in the House, I worked with former President Reagan on the modernization of our strategic weaponry. In the Senate I was one of only ten Democrats, along with Senator Joe Lieberman, to support Governor Bushs dad in the Persian Gulf War Resolution. And for the last eight years Ive served on the National Security Council. Can I say just one other thing here? I think he gets a -- oh, Im sorry, youre right, go ahead.MODERATOR: Mr. Allen, right there. Thank you, sir. Just to finish briefly, I started to say that for the last eight years Ive been on the National Security Council. Last week I broke up -- I suspended campaigning for two days, or parts of two days, to go back and participate in the meetings that charted the Presidents summit meeting that he just returned from earlier today. And our team of -- our countrys team over there did a great job. Its a difficult situation. The United States has to be strong in order to make sure that we can help promote peace and security and stability. And that means keeping our military strong. Now, I said earlier that we are the strongest military, but we need to continue improving readiness and making sure that our military personnel are adequately paid and that the combination of their pay and their benefits and their retirement as veterans is comparable to the stiff competition thats coming in this strong economy from the private sector. And I have supported the largest pay raise in many a year, and I support another one now. I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry. The governor has proposed skipping a generation of technology. I think that would be a mistake, because I think one of the ways weve been able to be so successful in Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti and in other places is by having the technological edge. You know, we won that conflict in Kosovo without losing a single human life in combat, a single American life in combat. Now, readiness. The trends before we -- before I got my current job were on the decline, the number of divisions were reduced. I argued that we should reverse that trend and take it back up. And Im happy to tell you that we have. Now, in my budget for the next ten years I propose $100 billion for this purpose. The governor proposes $45 billion. I propose more than twice as much because I think its needed.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, two minutes. Well, it was not one of my ads, either, Governor. But I am familiar with the statement, and it was made by one of the top-ranking officials of that organization. Let me tell you my position. I think that some common sense gun safety measures are certainly needed with the flood of cheap handguns that have sometimes been working their way into the hands of the wrong people. But all of my proposals are focused on that problem, gun safety. None of my proposals would have any effect on hunters, or sportsmen, or people who use rifles. Theyre aimed at the real problem. Lets make our schools safe, lets make our neighborhoods safe. Lets have a three-day waiting period, cooling off, so we can have a background check to make sure that criminals and people who really shouldnt have guns dont get them. But I would like to use my remaining time on this exchange, Jim, to respond to an exchange that took place just a moment ago. Because a couple of times the governor has said that I am for a bigger government. Governor, Im not. And let me tell you what the record shows. For the last eight years I have had the challenge of running the streamlining program called Reinventing Government. And if there are any federal employees in this group, you know what that means. The federal government has been reduced in size by more than 300,000 people. And its now the smallest number that we have had since the -- the smallest in size since John Kennedys administration. During the last five years, Texass government has gone up in size. Federal government has gone down, Texass government has gone up. Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you dont have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster. We can do that. Weve got a bumper crop this year. But thats the good news. You know what the bad news is that follows on that. The prices are low. In the last several years, the so-called Freedom To Farm Law has, in my view, been mostly a failure. I want to change many of its provisions. Now, many here who are not involved in farming dont -- wont follow this, so just forgive me. Because the 2% of the country that is involved in farming is important because the rest of us wouldnt eat except for them. And you guys have been having a hard time, and I want to fight for you. I want to change those provisions. I want to restore a meaningful safety net. And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, youre specifically including conservation and protection of the environment. And yes, farmers are the first environmentalists. And when they decide not to plow a field that is vulnerable to soil erosion, that may cost them a little money, but it helps the environment. I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program. And I think that the environmental benefits that come from sound management of the land ought to represent a new way for farmers to get some income that will enable them -- enable you to make sensible choices in crop rotation, and when you leave the land fallow and the rest. Now, Ill go beyond that and say I think we need much more focus on rural economic development programs. I see a time when the Internet-based activities are more available in the rural areas and where the extra source of income that farm families used to have from shoe factories is replaced by an extra source of income from working in the information economy. So we need to do a lot of things, but we ought to start with a better safety net.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, two minutes. Yeah. Im for a massive reform of the estate tax or the death tax. And under the plan that Ive proposed, 80% of all family farms will be completely exempt from the estate tax. And the vast majority of all family businesses would be completely exempt, and all of the others would have sharply reduced. So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%. The amount of money that has to be raised in taxes for middle-class families to make up for completely eliminating that on the very wealthiest, the billionaires, that would be an extra heavy burden on middle-class families. And so lets do it for most all, but not completely eliminate it for the very top. I care a lot about this. Its not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet. Parents now feel like you have to compete with the mass culture in order to raise your kids with the values that you want them to have. Tipper and I have four children. And God bless them, every one of them decided on their own to come here this evening. I dont want to embarrass our oldest daughter. She and her husband made us grandparents almost a year-and-a-half ago, and yet if shell forgive me, when she was little, she brought a record home that had some awful lyrics in it and Tipper hit the ceiling. And that launched a campaign to try to get the record companies to put ratings that -- warning labels for parents. And Im so proud of what she accomplished in getting them on there. Ive been involved myself in negotiating and helping to move along the negotiations with the Internet service providers to get a parents protection page every time 95% of the pages come up. And a feature that allows parents to automatically check with one click what sites your kids have visited lately. You know, some parents are worried about those filters, that you will have to ask your kids how to put them on there. But if you can check up on them, thats real power. And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then theyve turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children. That is an outrage. Joe Lieberman and I gave them six months to clean up their act. And if they dont do it, were gonna ask for tougher authority in the hands of the FTC on the false and deceptive advertising. Ill tell you this, I want to do something about this. Respect the First Amendment, but I will do something to help you raise your kids without that garbage. Right next to the left. Weve got to change it. I spend a good deal of time talking to young people, and in my standard speech out there on the stump I usually end my speech by saying, I want to ask you for something and I want to direct it especially to the young people in the audience. And I want to tell you what I tell them. Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arms length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then theyre gonna be let down and disappointed. But thank goodness weve always had enough people who have been willing in every generation to push past the fear of a broken heart and become deeply involved in forming a more perfect union. Were America, and we believe in our future and we know we have the ability to shape our future. Now, weve got to address one of the biggest threats to our democracy. And that is the current campaign financing system. And I know they say it doesnt rank anywhere on the polls. I dont believe thats a fair measure. Im telling you, I will make it the -- I will make the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform bill the very first measure that I send to the Congress as president. Governor Bush opposes it. I wish that he would consider changing his mind on that. Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people. Let me tell you why. Those issues you mentioned, Social Security, prescription drugs, the big drug companies are against the prescription drug proposal that Ive made. The HMOs are against the patients rights bill, the Dingle-Norwood bill that I support. The big oil companies are against the measures to get more energy independence and renewable fuel. They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldnt have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people. We need campaign finance reform and we need to shoot straight with young and old alike and tell them what the real choices are. And we can renew and rekindle the American spirit and make our future what our founders dreamed it could be. We can.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, two minutes. I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart. I believe that our future as a nation depends upon whether or not we can break down these barriers that have been used to pit group against group, and bring our people together. How do you do it? Well, you establish respect for differences. You dont ignore differences. Its all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, were just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that youve had, that others have had. Once you have that understanding and mutual respect, then we can transcend the differences and embrace the highest common denominator of the American spirit. I dont know what affirmative access means. I do know what affirmative action means. I know the governor is against it, and I know that Im for it. I know what a hate crime statute pending at the national level is all about in the aftermath of James Byrds death. Im for that proposed law, the governor is against it. I know what it means to have a commitment to diversity. I am part of an administration that has the finest record on diversity. And incidentally, an excellent -- I mean, I think our success over the last eight years has not been in spite of diversity but because of it. Because were able to draw on the wisdom and experience from different parts of the society that hadnt been tapped in the same way before. And incidentally, Mel Carnahan in Missouri had the finest record on diversity in any governor in the entire history of the State of Missouri. And I want to honor that among his other achievements here. Now, I just believe that what we have to do is enforce the civil rights laws. Im against quotas. This is, with all due respect, Governor, thats a red herring. Affirmative action isnt quotas. Im against quotas, theyre illegal. Theyre against the American way. Affirmative action means that you take extra steps to acknowledge the history of discrimination and injustice and prejudice and bring all people into the American dream because it helps everybody, not just those who are directly benefitting. He said if affirmative action means quotas, hes against it. Affirmative action doesnt mean quotas. Are you for it without quotas? Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action? I think that speaks for itself. If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, youll get a tax credit, which means in essence that the federal government will match your $1,000 with another $1,000. If you make less than $30,000 a year and you put $500 in a savings account, the federal government will match it with $1500. If you make more than $60,000 and up to 100 youll still get a match, but not as generous. Youll get an access to life-long learning and education, help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or training. If you want to purchase health insurance, you will get help with that. If you want to participate in some of the dynamic changes that are going on in our country, you will get specific help in doing that. If you are part of the -- of the bottom 20% or so of wage earners, then you will get an expanded earned income tax credit. Now, the tax relief that I propose is directed specifically at middle-income individuals and families. And if you have a -- if you have an elderly parent or grandparent who needs long-term care, then you will get help with that. $3,000 tax credit to help your expenses in taking care of a loved one who needs long-term care.MODERATOR: Governor Bush? I support the death penalty. I think that it has to be administered not only fairly with attention to things like DNA evidence, which I think should be used in all capital cases, but also with very careful attention. If, for example, somebody confesses to the crime and somebody is waiting on death row, there has to be alertness to say wait a minute, have we got the wrong guy? If the wrong guy is put to death, then thats a double tragedy. Not only has an innocent person been executed, but the real perpetrator of the crime has not been held accountable for it. And in some cases may be still at large. But I support the death penalty in the most heinous cases. I think it is a deterrent. I know thats a controversial view, but I do believe its a deterrent. Yes. (LAUGHTER) I am a person who keeps promises. And, you know, weve heard a lot about -- from the governor about not much being done in the last eight years, as if the promises that I made eight years ago have not been kept. I think the record shows otherwise. We have gone from the biggest deficits eight years ago to the biggest surpluses in history today. Instead of high unemployment, we now have the lowest African-American unemployment, the lowest Latino unemployment ever measured. 22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally. Instead of ballooning the debt and multiplying it four times over, we have seen the debt actually begun to be paid down. Here are some promises that Ill make to you now. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the debt every year. I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones. And I will invest in education, health care, protecting the environment and retirement security. We both made promises in this campaign. I promise you I will keep mine. Let me tell you about one of the governors. He has promised a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund for young working adults to invest and save on their own. But hes promised seniors that their Social Security benefits will not be cut, and hes promised the same trillion dollars to them. So this is a show me state. Reminds me of the line from the movie, Show me the money. Which one of those promises will be keep and which will you break, Governor?MODERATOR: Governor Bush. Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said. Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people. And you cannot keep both promises. If youre in your mid-40s under the governors plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund. Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until youre 100. Now that is the difference. And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this. This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future. The reason Social Security -- he says it gets 2%. You know, its not a bank account that just pays back money thats invested. It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on. If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors? Now let me come directly to your question. Thank you very much, Jim, and Ill begin by answering your questions -- your last question. I believe that a lot of people are skeptical about people in politics today because we have seen a time of great challenge for our country. Since the assassination of our best leaders in the 60s, since the Vietnam War, since Watergate, and because we need campaign finance reform. I would like to tell you something about me. I keep my word. I have kept the faith. Ive kept the faith with my country. I volunteered for the Army. I served in Vietnam. I kept the faith with my family. Tipper and I have been married for 30 years. We have devoted ourselves to our children and now our nearly one-and-a-half-year-old grandson. I have kept the faith with our country. Nine times I have raised my hand to take an oath to the Constitution, and I have never violated that oath. I have not spent the last quarter century in pursuit of personal wealth. I have spent the last quarter century fighting for middle-class working men and women in the United States of America. I believe very deeply that you have to be willing to stand up and fight no matter what powerful forces might be on the other side. If you want somebody who is willing to fight for you, I am asking for your support and your vote and, yes, your confidence and your willingness to believe that we can do the right thing in America, and be the better for it. Weve made some progress during the last eight years. We have seen the strongest economy in the history of the United States. Lower crime rates for eight years in a row. Highest private home ownership ever, but Ill make you one promise here. You aint seen nothing yet. And I will keep that promise.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, two minutes.\"\"\",\"\"\" I, too, want to extend my prayers and blessings, Gods blessings on the families whose lives were overturned yes -- tod -- last night. Its a tragic moment. Actually, Mr. Vice President, its not true. I do support a national patients bill of rights. As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patients bill of rights through. It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and thats what we did in my state. We have one of the most advanced patients bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesnt have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist. It says that you cant gag a doctor, doctor can advise you. The HMO, the insurance company, cant gag that doctor from giving you full advice. And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to. But we did something else that was interesting. Were one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage. Now theres whats called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first. It says you have a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesnt follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law. Its time for our nation to come together and do whats right for the people, and I think this is right for the people. You know, I support a national patients bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered. I dont want the law to supersede good law like weve got in Texas. I think -- Well, the difference is is that I can get it done. That I can get something positive done on behalf of the people. Thats what the question in this campaign is about. Its not only whats your philosophy and whats your position on issues, but can you get things done? And I believe I can. Im not quite through. Let me finish. I talked about the principles and the issues that I think are important in a patients bill of rights. Its kind of Washington, D.C. focus. Well, its in this committee or its got this sponsor. If Im the president, were going to have emergency room care, were going have gag orders, were going to have direct access to OB/GYN. People will be able to take their HMO insurance company to court. Thats what Ive done in Texas and thats the kind of leadership style Ill bring to Washington. Well, thats a great question. I think one of the problems we have, particularly for seniors, is there is no prescription drug coverage in Medicare. And therefore, when they have to try to purchase drugs they do so on their own, theres no kind of collective bargaining, no power of purchasing among seniors. So I think step one to make sure prescription drugs is more affordable for seniors, and those are the folks who really rely upon prescription drugs a lot these days, is to reform the Medicare system, is to have precipitation drugs as an integral part of Medicare once and for all. The problem we have today is like the patients bill of rights, particularly with health care, theres a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C. Its kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue. So what I want to do is I want to call upon Republicans and Democrats to forget all the arguing and finger pointing, and come together and take care of our seniors prescription drug program, that says well pay for the poor seniors, well help all seniors with prescription drugs. In the meantime, I think its important to have whats called Immediate Helping Hand, which is direct money to states so that seniors, poor seniors, dont have to choose between food and medicine. Thats part of an overall overhaul. The purchasing powers. And Im against price controls. I think price controls would hurt our ability to continue important research and development. Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it. One of the most important things is to continue the research and development component. And so Im against price controls. Expediting drugs through the FDA makes sense, of course. Allowing the new bill that was passed in the Congress made sense to allow for, you know, drugs that were sold overseas to come back and other countries to come back into the United States. That makes sense. But the best thing to do is to reform Medicare. Im absolutely opposed to a national health care plan. I dont want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers. I remember what the administration tried to do in 1993. They tried to have a national health care plan. And fortunately, it failed. I trust people, I dont trust the federal government. Its going to be one of the themes you hear tonight. I dont want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody. There is an issue with the uninsured, there sure is. And we have uninsured people in my state. Ours is a big state, a fast-growing state. We share a common border with another nation. But were providing health care for our people. One thing about insurance, thats a Washington term. The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America. There needs to be more community health clinics where the poor can go get health care. We need a program for the uninsured. Theyve been talking about it in Washington, D.C. The number of uninsured has now gone up for the past seven years. We need a $2,000 credit, rebate for people, working people that dont have insurance, they can get in the marketplace and start purchasing insurance. We need to have -- allow small businesses to write insurance across jurisdictional lines so small business can afford health care, small restaurants can afford health care. So health care needs to be affordable and available. We have to trust people to make decisions with their lives. In the Medicare reform I talk about it says if you are a senior, you can stay in Medicare if you like it, and thats fine, but were going to give you other choices to choose if you want to do so, just like they do the federal employees. The people that work in Washington, D.C. for the U.S. Congress or the United States senate. Get a variety of choices to make in their lives. And thats what we ought to do for all people in America.MODERATOR: Yes, sir, sorry.GORE: Follow-up? Well, you know, its hard to make people love one another. I wish I knew the law because I would darn sure sign it. I wish I knew the law that said all of us would be good parents. One of the things the next president must do is to remind people that if we are going to have a responsible period in America, that each of us must love our children with all our heart and all our soul. I happened to believe strong accountability encourages parental involvement, though. I think when you measure and post results on the Internet or in the town newspapers, most parents say wait a minute, my childs school isnt doing what I want it to do and, therefore, become involved in education. I recognize there are some who just dont seem to care. But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their childs school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards arent being met. Thats why Im so strong for accountability. I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade. We do so in my state of Texas. One of the good things weve gone in Texas is we have strong accountability because you cant cure unless you know. You cant solve a problem unless you diagnose it. I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure. Thats why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they cant be sued. They cant be sued. I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their childrens classrooms are safe and secure as well. I also believe that we need to say to people that if you cannot meet standards, there has to be a consequence. Instead of just comes the soft bigotry of low expectations, that there has to be a consequence. We cant continue to shuffle children through school. And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.MODERATOR: Governor. Vice president Gore. Yeah, I appreciate that. I think any time we end with one of these attacks, its appropriate to respond. Heres what I think. First of all, vouchers are up to states. If you want to do a voucher program in Missouri, fine. I strongly believe in local control of schools. Im a governor of state and I dont like it when the federal government tells us what to do. I believe in local control of schools. But heres what I said. Ive said to the extent we send federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning. Whats unreasonable about that? We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement. And if we find success well praise it. But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence. And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school. You see, there has to be a consequence. Weve got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through. And guess who suffers. When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, its the largest increase in federal spending in years. And theres just not going to be enough money. I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority. Thats what governors ought to do. They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state. The federal government puts about 6% of the money up. They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork. I dont know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of its because of the federal government. What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money. One size does not fit all. I worry about federalizing education if I were you. I believe strongly that the federal government can help, need the funds, Headstart. We need to have accountability. The Vice Presidents plan does not have annual accountability, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade. We need to demand on results. I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned. I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom. Part of its because you cant -- you cant control the classroom. You cant have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law. So Im going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act. So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum. There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money. The federal government can be a part, but dont fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level. 94% comes from the local level. Well, hes wrong. (LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers. Its three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed. The Senate Budget Committee -- Forget the journalists. He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined. This is a big spender. And you ought to be proud of it, its part of his record. We just have a different philosophy. Let me talk about tax relief. If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief. The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I dont think thats the role of the president to pick youre right and youre not right. I think if youre going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it. And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it. But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits. And thats because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes. If youre a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes. What Ive done is set priorities and funded them. And theres extra money. And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back. Its a difference of opinion. He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money. I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people. Its just the right position to take. Of course it does. If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit. People who pay taxes will get tax relief. Let me finish. Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today. Afterwards they pay 64%. This is a fair plan. You know why? Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If youre a single mother making $22,000 a year today and youre trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and thats not right. So I want to do something about that.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? Good. 50 million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.GORE: Thats not right. You may not be one of them, youre just not one of the right people. And secondly, weve had enough fighting. Its time to unite. You talk about eight years? In eight years they havent gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patients bill of rights. Its time to get something done. Ive been a leader. Ive been a person who has to set a clear vision and convince people to follow. Ive got a strategy for the Middle East. And first let me say that our nation now needs to speak with one voice during this time, and I applaud the president for working hard to diffuse tensions. Our nation needs to be credible and strong. When we say were somebodys friend, everybody has got to believe it. Israel is our friend and well stand by Israel. We need to reach out to modern Arab nations as well. To build coalitions to keep the peace. I also need -- the next leader needs to be patient. We cant put the Middle East peace process on our timetable. Its got to be on the timetable of the people that were trying to bring to the peace table. We cant dictate the terms of peace, which means that you have to be steady. You cant worry about polls or focus groups. Youve got to have a clear vision. Thats what a leader does. A leader also understands that the United States must be strong to keep the peace. Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East. Our coalition against Saddam is unraveling. Sanctions are loosened. The man who may be developing weapons of mass destruction, we dont know because inspectors arent in. So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? If this were a spending contest, I would come in second. I readily admit Im not going to grow the size of the federal government like he is. Your question was deployment. It must be in the national interests, must be in our vital interests whether we ever send troops. The mission must be clear. Soldiers must understand why were going. The force must be strong enough so that the mission can be accomplished. And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined. Im concerned that were overdeployed around the world. See, I think the mission has somewhat become fuzzy. Should I be fortunate enough to earn your confidence, the mission of the United States military will be to be prepared and ready to fight and win war. And therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often. The Vice President mentioned my view of long-term for the military. I want to make sure the equipment for our military is the best it can possibly be, of course. But we have an opportunity -- we have an opportunity to use our research and development capacities, the great technology of the United States, to make our military lighter, harder to find, more lethal. We have an opportunity, really, if you think about it, if were smart and have got a strategic vision and a leader who understands strategic planning, to make sure that we change the terms of the battlefield of the future so we can keep the peace. This is a peaceful nation, and I intend to keep the peace. Spending money is one thing. But spending money without a strategic plan can oftentimes be wasted. First thing Im going to do is ask the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan so we are making sure were not spending our money on political projects, but on projects to make sure our soldiers are well-paid, well-housed, and have the best equipment in the world. Im sorry, I didnt hear that. I dont think the National Rifle Association ran that ad. But let me just tell you my position on guns in general, sir, if you dont mind. Well, I dont think I ran the ad. I think somebody who doesnt want me to be president might have run that ad. That wasnt my ad. I think it might have been one of my opponents ads. Here is what I believe, sir. I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be allowed to protect themselves and their families. I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldnt have them. Thats why Im for instant background checks at gun shows, Im for trigger locks, I think that makes sense. Matter of fact, we distributed free trigger locks in the State of Texas so that people can get them and put them on their guns to make their guns more safe. I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun. But I also believe strongly that we need to enforce laws on the books that the best way to make sure that we keep our society safe and secure is to hold people accountable for breaking the law. If we catch somebody illegally selling a gun, there needs to be a consequence. If we keep somebody -- you know, illegally using a gun, there needs to be a consequence. Enforcement of law, and the federal government can help. There is a great program called Project Exile in Richmond, Virginia, where we focused federal taxpayers money and federal prosecutors and went after people who were illegally using guns. To me thats how you make society the safest it can be. And so, yeah, sometimes I agree with some of these groups in Washington and sometimes I dont. Im a pretty independent thinker. The one thing Im for is a safe society. And Im for enforcing laws on the books. And thats what is going to happen should I earn your confidence.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? I would like our farmers feeding the world. Were the best producers in the world, and I want -- I want the farmers feeding the world. We need to open up markets. Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer. I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world with the best and the most efficient farmers. I dont want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward. We shouldnt be using food. It hurts the farmers. Its not the right thing to do. Im for value-added processing. We need more work on value-added processing. You take the raw product you produce, I presume youre a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it. Value-added processing is important. Im for research and development. Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products. Im for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax. One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax. This is a bad tax. The President shouldnt have vetoed that bill. Its a tax that taxes people twice. It penalizes the family farmer. So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand -- I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security. Im from a big farm state. Were the second biggest state -- farming state in the country. And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time. The Vice President is right, by the way. Every day is earth day if you own the land. I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put -- set aside land as well for conservation purposes. Thank you. Because people shouldnt be taxed twice on their assets. Its either unfair for some or unfair for all. Again, this is just a difference of opinion. If youre from Washington, you want to pick and choose winners. I dont think thats the role of the president. I think if youre going to have tax relief, everybody benefits. Secondly, I think your plan -- a lot of fine print in your plan, Mr. Vice President, with all due respect. It is -- Im not so sure 80% of the people get the death tax. I know this, 100% will get it if Im the president. I just dont think its fair to tax peoples assets twice regardless of your status. Its a fairness issue. Its an issue of principle, not politics. Appreciate that question. Laura and I are proud parents of teenage girls, twin daughters, and I know what youre saying. Government ought to stand on the side of parents. Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture. You bet theres things that government can do. We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in. I think we ought to have character education in our schools. I know that doesnt directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values youre teaching. Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time. Theres afterschool money available. I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith-based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well. Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because were free. And so I dont support censorship. But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences. I think we need to have rating systems that are clear. I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you dont want in your house. Ill remind mothers and dads the best weapon is the off/on button, and paying attention to your children, and eating dinner with them and being -- Im sorry.GORE: My turn.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore. Tell you what I hear. A lot of people are sick and tired of the bitterness in Washington, D.C. and therefore they dont want any part of politics. They look at Washington and see people pointing fingers and casting blame and saying one thing and doing another. Theres a lot of young folks saying, you know, why do I want to be involved with this mess? And what I think needs to happen in order to encourage the young to become involved is to shoot straight, is to set aside the partisan differences, and set an agenda that will make sense. Medicare, I know you talked about it, but Medicare is relevant for all of us, young and old alike. We better get it right now. Tax reform is relevant for old and young alike. I dont think its the issues that turn kids off. I think its the tone. I think its the attitude. I think its a cynicism in Washington and it doesnt have to be that way. Before I decided to run, I had to resolve two issues in my mind. One, could our family endure all this business. And I came to the conclusion that our love was strong enough to be able to do it. The other was could an administration change the tone in Washington, D.C. And I believe the answer is yes, otherwise I wouldnt be asking for your vote. Thats what happened in Texas. We worked together. There is a man here in this audience named Hugo Berlanga. He is the chairman of the health committee. He came here for a reason, to tout our record on health in Texas. Hes a Democrat. I didnt care whether he was a Republican or Democrat. What I cared about is could we work together. Thats what Washington, D.C. needs. And finally, sir, to answer your question, you need somebody in office who will tell the truth. Thats the best way to get people back in the system. Ive had a record of bringing people from all walks of life into my administration, and my administration is better off for it in Texas. Im going to find people that want to serve their country. But I want a diverse administration, I think its important. Ive worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy. Policy that rejects quotas. I dont like quotas. Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another. Quotas are bad for America. Its not the way America is all about. But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves. For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, youre automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college. And as a result, our universities are now more diverse. It was a smart thing to do. What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access. I think the contracting business in government can help. Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example. The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be -- need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts. I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential. So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access. Ill have an administration that will make you proud. Thank you.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? If affirmative action means quotas, Im against it. If affirmative action means what I just described what Im for, then Im for it. You heard what I was for. The vice president keeps saying Im against things. You heard what I was for, and thats what I support. I may not be for your version, Mr. Vice President, but Im for what I just described to the lady. No, it doesnt speak for itself, Mr. Vice President, it speaks for the fact that there are certain rules in this that we all agree to, but evidently rules dont mean anything. Let me just say the first -- this business about the entitlement he tried to describe about savings, you know, matching savings here and matching savings there, fully-funded its gonna cost a whole lot of money, a lot more than we have. Youre going to get a tax refund in my plan. Youre not going to be targeted in or targeted out. Everybody that pays taxes is going to get tax relief. If you take care of an elderly in your home, youre going to get the personal exemption increased. I think also what you need to think about is not the immediate, but what about Medicare? You get a plan that will include prescription drugs, a plan that will give you options. Now, I hope people understand that Medicare today is important, but it doesnt keep up with the new medicines. If youre a Medicare person, on Medicare, you dont get the new procedures. Youre stuck in a time warp in many ways. So it will be a modern Medicare system that trusts you to make a variety of options for you. Youre going to live in a peaceful world. It will be a world of peace because were going to have a clear sight of foreign policy based upon a strong military and a mission that stands by our friends. A mission that doesnt try to be all things to all people. A judicious use of the military which will help keep the peace. Youll live in a world, hopefully, that is more educated so its less likely youll be harmed in your neighborhood. See, an educated child is one much more likely to be hopeful and optimistic. Youll be in a world in which fits into my philosophy. The harder you work, the more you can keep. Its the American way. Government shouldnt be a heavy hand. Its what the federal government does to you. It should be a helping hand, and tax relief and the proposals I just described should be a good helping hand. No, Im not proud of that. The death penalty is a very serious business, Leo. Its an issue that good people obviously disagree on. I take my job seriously. And if you think I was proud of it, I think you misread me, I do. I was sworn to uphold the laws of my state. During the course of the campaign in 1994 I was asked do you support the death penalty. I said I did if administered fairly and justly. Because I believe it saves lives, Leo, I do. If its administered swiftly, justly and fairly, it saves lives. One of the things that happens when youre a governor, at least oftentimes you have to make tough decisions. You cant let public persuasion sway you, because the job is to enforce the law. And thats what I did, sir. There have been some tough cases come across my desk. Some of the hardest moments since Ive been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases. But my job is to ask two questions, sir. Is the person guilty of the crime? And did the person have full access to the courts of law? And I can tell you looking at you right now, in all cases those answers were affirmative. Im not proud of any record. Im proud of the fact that violent crime is down in the State of Texas. Im proud of the fact that we hold people accountable. But Im not proud of any record, sir, Im not.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? I do. Its the only reason to be for it. Let me finish, sir. I dont think you should support the death penalty to seek revenge. I dont think thats right. I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other peoples lives. Thank you for your question. (LAUGHTER) I -- theres an old high school debating trick, which is to answer something and then attack your opponent at the end. You asked about promises. You were promised that Medicare would be reformed, and that Social Security would be reformed. You were promised a middle-class tax cut in 1992. It didnt happen. Theres too much bitterness in Washington. Theres too much wrangling. Its time to have a fresh start. One of the reasons I was successful as the governor of Texas is because I didnt try to be all things to all people. When I campaigned in a race, a lot of folks didnt think I could win including, by the way, my mother. (LAUGHTER) I said Id do four things; tort reform, education reform, welfare reform and juvenile justice reform. And I won. And I had the will of the people in my state behind me. And then I brought folks together to get it done. And thats what we need, I think, in this election. To me thats what its all about. Im sure your 6th grade kids are listening and saying, these guys will say anything to get elected. But theres a record, and thats what I hope people look at. One of my promises is going to be Social Security reform, and you bet, we need to take a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus. Now remember, Social Security revenue exceeds expenses up until 2015. People are going to get paid. But if youre a younger worker, if youre younger, you better hope this country thinks differently, otherwise youre gonna be faced with huge payroll taxes or reduced benefits. And you bet were gonna take a trillion dollars of your own money and let you invest it under safe guidelines so you get a better rate of return on the money than the paltry 2% that the federal government gets for you today. Thats one of my promises. But its gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done. Thats what it requires. There was a chance to get this done. It was a bipartisan approach, but its been rejected. Im going to bring them together. Well, can I answer that? One reason people are skeptical is because people dont answer the questions theyve been asked. The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money. Theres just a difference of opinion. I want workers to have their own assets. Its who you trust, government or people. Well, Jim, I want to thank you and thank the folks here at Washington University and the vice president. Appreciate the chance to have a good, honest dialogue about our differences of opinion. I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion. There is a difference between big federal government and somebody who is coming from outside of Washington who will trust individuals. Ive got an agenda that I want to get done for the country. Its an agenda that says were going to reform Medicare to make sure seniors have got prescription drugs and to give seniors different options from which they can choose. Its an agenda that says were listen to the young voices in Social Security and say were going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America. A promise made will be a promise kept should I be fortunate enough to become your president. I want to have the military keeping the peace. I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind. After setting priorities, I want to give some of your money back. I dont think the surplus is the governments money. I think its the peoples money. I dont think it exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government, I think in exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American people. And you ought to have some of this surplus so you can save and dream and build. I look forward to the final weeks of this campaign. Im asking for your vote. For those of you for me, thanks for your help. For those of you for my opponent, please only vote once. (LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise. Should I be fortunate enough to become your president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of the land, but I will also swear to uphold the honor and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God. Thank you very much.\"\"\",\"\"\" Now, lets go to the first question. Of over the 130 questions we received from this panel, we will begin with one of the 19 on health issues, and it goes to you, Mr. Vice President, and it will be asked by James Hankin. Mr. Hankin? Two minutes response, Governor Bush. Governor, time is up, sir. Just a minute, Mr. Vice President. I want to -- the way the rules go here now, two minutes, two minutes, and then Ill decide whether we go on. Okay. So what I want to make sure is we understand here is before we go on to another question in the health area, would you agree that you two agree on a national patients bill of rights? Governor Bush, you may answer that if youd like. But also Id like to know how you see the differences between the two of you, and we need to move on. All right. Were going to go now to another -- all right. Yes. All right. Another -- the next question also on health issue is from -- it will be asked by Marie Payne Kloep, and it goes to Governor Bush. Vice President Gore, two minutes. All right. Another health question, it comes from Vickie French, and its for you, Vice President Gore. Vickie French, where are you? Oh, there she is. Time is up. Governor Bush, two minutes. Not right now. Education. These folks submitted 18 questions on education, and the first one is that will be asked on education will go to you, Governor, and asked by Angie Pettig. Angie Pettig, where are you? There she is, Governor, right there. Governor, what is your position on that? Whats the harm on that, whats the other side on that? So no vouchers under -- in a Gore administration? Andrew Kosberg has a related question on education thats right on this subject. Mr. Kosberg, where are you? And its for Vice President Gore. Thats a violation of your rule, Vice President Gore. Vice President Gore, is the governor right when he says that youre proposing the largest federal spending in years? Governor, the vice president says youre wrong. Three times -- excuse me, three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed? Governor -- yeah, hold on one second here, thought. The governor just reversed the thing. What do you say specifically to what the vice president said tonight, he said it many, many times, that your tax cut benefits the top 1% of the wealthiest Americans, and youve heard what he said. All right. Why shouldnt they? It would be a violation of the rules. They couldnt -- Quick, and then were moving on. Speaking of keepers of the score card, thats what Im trying to do here Mr. Vice President and Governor Bush. Were gonna move on. Were gonna have to move on. All right, there were 12 questions on foreign and military matters, and the first one that were going to ask will be directed to you, Governor Bush. And David Norwood is going to ask it. Mr. Norwood, where are you? There you are. No, sir. Well get that -- Im gonna -- the next question is to you.GORE: Fine, Ill wait. Its a related -- its a related question that is going to be asked by Kenneth Allen. Mr. Allen? Governor Bush, another kind of gun question. It will be asked by Robert Lutz. Mr. Lutz? Excuse me, Im not sure hes finished with his question.BUSH: Im sorry. Steve Luecker has a question, and it is for Vice President Gore. Mr. Luecker? There you are. A quick thing on the inheritance tax. There is a difference between the two of you on this. Vice President Gore? Whats the case for doing that, Governor?BUSH: Eliminating the death tax.MODERATOR: Completely. New issue. New issue. And the question will be asked by Joyce Cleamer of Governor Bush. Joyce Cleamer? There you are.BUSH: Hi, Joyce. All right. Vice President Gore, the next question is for you, and it will be asked by Steven Koosmann. Mr. Koosmann, where are you, sir? Youre right behind me as well. There we go. Governor Bush, Norma Curby has the next question. And its for you. Norma Curby, where are you?BUSH: Hi, Norma. Governor, what is your -- are you opposed to affirmative action? What about -- Mr. Vice President, you heard what he said. Lets go on to another -- The question is for you, Vice President Gore, and Lisa Kee will ask it. Lisa Kee, where are you? There we go, sorry. Governor, next question is for you, and Leo Anderson will ask it. Mr. Anderson. You want a mike? Do both of you believe the death penalty actually deters crime? Governor? Next question is for you, Vice President Gore, and Thomas Fischer will ask it. Mr. Fischer? Both of you -- both of you on this subject. There are other questions that also go to this skepticism, not necessarily about you, but all people in politics. Why is that? We have to go to the closing statements and -- All right. Now were going to go to closing statements. Vice President Gore, youre first. A closing piece of business before we go. The Debate Commission wants reaction to the three kinds of formats used in the debates this year, and you may register an opinion at their website at www.debates.org. Vice President Gore, Governor Bush, thank you. And good night from Washington University in St. Louis.(APPLAUSE)\"\"\"\n",
      "October 11 2000 ,AL GORE,GEORGE BUSH,\"\"\" Yes, Jim. Ive thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world. I see it as a question of values. It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be. And I dont think thats just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans. Its really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us. As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, theyre wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is Americas greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where theyre having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. So weve got to enforce our civil rights laws. Weve got to deal with things like racial profiling. And we have to keep our military strong. We have the strongest military, and Ill do whatever is necessary, if Im president, to make sure that it stays that way. But our real power comes, I think, from our values. I agree with that. I agree with that. I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway. That there is some resentment of U.S. power. So I think that the idea of humility is an important one. But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. We have to protect our capacity to push forward what Americas all about. That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong. You know, in the last, or two decades ago it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because its causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time. The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. We need to do more. But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent. The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that hes not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- hes dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that hes talking about there. The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. Its a very tense situation there. But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. Its too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.MODERATOR: Governor? Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker. And one of the reasons thats important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us. And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset thats important not only to us but also to Israel. I havent heard a big difference in the last few exchanges. Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power. I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that thats the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that theyre too weak to do it, but thats what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governors not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, Im told, except for three where they notified, and theyre trying to break out of the box, theres no question about it. I dont think they should be allowed to. Well, Ive been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years. When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and hes still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions weve had about when its appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that youve laid down have given me the impression that if its something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldnt be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think its based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong? Can you run through the list again?MODERATOR: Sure. Lebanon. I thought that was a mistake.MODERATOR: Grenada.GORE: I supported that.MODERATOR: Panama.GORE: I supported that.MODERATOR: Persian Gulf. Yes, I voted for it, supported it.MODERATOR: Somalia. Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered. I did support it at the time. It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.MODERATOR: Bosnia.GORE: Oh, yes.MODERATOR: Haiti.GORE: Yes.MODERATOR: And then Kosovo.GORE: Yes. Id like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. We tried everything else. If we have allies in the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa we did not. Now, we have tried -- our countries tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and weve met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission. I dont think we agree on that. I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. I think we have to be very reticent about that. But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldnt be, doesnt mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the others position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late 40s and 50s and 60s? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back. I dont disagree with that. I certainly dont disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. Thats what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. Thats really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. And, you know, we cant be -- we cant allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that. And thats why Ive supported building up our capacity. Ive devoted in the budget Ive proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that its in better shape now than he generally does. Weve had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and thats not what the joint chiefs say. But theres no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength. And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military. No, I would make some changes. I think there need to be reforms in the IMF. Ive generally supported it, but Ive seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable. And I think that theres a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF. The World Bank I think is generally doing a better job, but I think one of the big issues here that doesnt get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption. The governor mentioned it earlier. Ive worked on this issue. Its an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, thats one of the worst forms of it. And we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it. I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history. The world has come together, as I said, theyre looking to us. And we have a fundamental choice to make. Are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after World War II, the way that generation of heroes said okay, the United States is going to be the leader. And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years. I think that in the aftermath of the Cold War, its time for us to do something very similar, to step up to the plate, to provide the leadership on the environment, leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction. Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus. It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role. Far be it from me to suggest otherwise. (LAUGHTER) Yes, I would. The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know its been going on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years. But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. And I was surprised at the extent of it. And I think weve now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. And its not an easy problem to solve. But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century. I would agree. And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also. I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training. And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations. And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America. And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas. And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity. And thats why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law. I think these crimes are different. I think theyre different because theyre based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but theyre intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people. Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws. I think we still need affirmative action. I would pass a hate crimes law, as I said, and I guess I had misunderstood the governors previous position. The Byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in Texas also. But I would like to shift, if I could, to the big issue of education. Well, I had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in Texas was -- failed, and that the Byrd family, among others, asked you to support it, Governor, and it died in committee for lack of support. Am I wrong about that? I dont want to jump in. I may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter, because the law that was proposed in Texas that had the support of the Byrd family and a whole lot of people in Texas did, in fact, die in committee. There may be some other statute that was already on the books, but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed. And its important, Jim, not only -- not just because of Texas, but because this mirrors the national controversy. There is pending now in the Congress a national hate crimes law because of James Byrd, because of Matthew Shepard, who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots, and because of others. And that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition. I agree with that, and I did support that law. But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman. And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.MODERATOR: Is that right? Well, theres a law pending called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. I strongly support it. What it says is that gays and lesbians cant be fired from their job because theyre gay or lesbian. And it would be a federal law preventing that. Now, I wonder if the -- its been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress. I wonder if the Governor who lend his support to that law.MODERATOR: Governor?BUSH: The question -- Jim, I hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and I have a very different view than the one he expressed. But that having been said, I believe that -- well, first of all, let me say that the governor and I agree on some things where this subject is concerned. I will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen. I think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to. The problem I see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children, and criminals, and people who, for whatever reason, some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns. I think these assault weapons are a problem. So I favor closing the gun show loophole. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to close it, but then the majority in the House of Representatives went the other way. Thats still pending. If we could get agreement on that, maybe they could pass that in the final days of this Congress. I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law. I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively. Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years. I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate. I think that we ought to make all schools gun free. Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country. I think that measures like these are important. Child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis, and others.MODERATOR: Governor? Well, Im not for registration. I am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases.MODERATOR: Whats that mean? A photo license I.D. like a drivers license for new handguns and, you know, the Los Angeles -- The state. The state. I think states should do that for new handguns, because too many criminals are getting guns. There was a recent investigation of the number in Texas who got -- who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records. And the Los Angeles Times spent a lot of ink going into that. But I am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen, rifles, shotguns, existing handguns. I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now. Look, this is the year -- this is in the aftermath of Columbine, and Paducah, and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people. The woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at Columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there, she would not have bought those guns. That conceivably could have prevented that tragedy. I also believe in the Golden Rule. And I agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said. We do have a serious problem in our culture. Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children. Shes worked on it longer than I have. But I feel very strongly about that. And if Im elected president, I will do something about that. But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting. But I dont think that we can ignore the role played by guns. I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools. And the reason its so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them. And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands. Its one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years. I would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care, but Im not for a government-run system. In fact, Im for shrinking the size of government. I want a smaller and smarter government. I have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project thats reduced the size of government by more than 300,000 people in the last several years. And the budget plan that Ive put out, according to the Los Angeles Times again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years. So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people. But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country. I think its intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance. So its one of my top priorities. Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this. And Im sorry to tell you that, you know, there is a record here. And Texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care -- in children with health care. 49th for women with health care, and 50th for families with health care. So it is a priority for me. I guarantee you. Im not aware of any program -- well, Ill just leave it at that. I think it ought to be a top priority. Well, I dont know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didnt answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct. And as for why it happened, Im no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered. And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests. He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program. Theres -- you dont have to take my word for this. There is now a federal judges opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do -- you should read that judges language about this. I believe there are 1.4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance. 600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldnt sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up. Yes, yes. But its not a statement about his heart. I dont claim to know his heart. I think hes a good person. I make no allegations about that. I believe him when he says that he has a good heart. I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person. But I think its about his priorities. And let me tell you exactly why I think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this -- I mean, if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families, and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history, wouldnt you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to, say, 45 or 40 or something or maybe better? I would. Now, but here is why its directly relevant, Jim. Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined. According to his own numbers. So its not a question of his heart, as far as I know. Its a question of priorities and values. See, you know --MODERATOR: Let me ask -- I do. I think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of whats called global warming. There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years. Already people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say theyve never seen before in their lifetimes. And whats happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly. Now, here is the good news, Jim. If we take the leadership role and build the new technologies, like the new kinds of cars and trucks that Detroit is itching to build, then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies. You know the Japanese are breathing down our necks on this. Theyre moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market. Some of these other countries, particularly in the developing world, their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living. And so theyre looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time. I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated. We have to be bold. We have to provide leadership. Now its true that we disagree on this. The governor said that he doesnt think this problem is necessarily caused by people. Hes for letting the oil companies into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country. And Texas is number one in industrial pollution. We have a very different outlook. And Ill tell you this, I will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy.MODERATOR: Governor? Im really strongly committed to clean water and clean air, and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming. He is right that Im not in favor of energy taxes. I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies. And let me say again, Detroit is rearing to go on that. We differ on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as I have said. We differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary. I dont think you can -- I dont think you can get results that way. We differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make. I think its a fundamental difference. Let me give you an example.MODERATOR: Hold on one second.GORE: Okay, sure. Well, that vote wasnt exactly -- a lot of the supporters of the Kyoto Treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded. But theres no doubt theres a lot of opposition to it in the Senate. Im not for command and control techniques either. Im for working with the groups, not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with. But I disagree that we dont know the cause of global warming. I think that we do. Its pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this. Look, the worlds temperature is going up, weather patterns are changing, storms are getting more violent and unpredictable. What are we going to tell our children? Im a grandfather now. I want to be able to tell my grandson when Im in my later years that I didnt turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm. In my faith tradition, it is -- its written in the book of Matthew, Where your heart is, there is your treasure also. And I believe that -- that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way thats good for them. Ive been trying so hard not to. Thats an interruption, by the way. I got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that I used, Jim, and Im sorry about that. And Im going to try to do better. One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make. However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesnt change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that. There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes. More sometimes than people in foreign countries. And we need to do something about that. Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next presidents term of four years is over. But right away. And that means doing it under the Medicare program. I cant promise that I will never get another detail wrong. I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard. But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if Im elected president, Ill work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people. I dont use language like that and I dont think that we should.MODERATOR: Its in your commercial. I understand. The -- I havent seen that, in my commercials? I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy. I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person. Well, I wasnt the one having trouble explaining it. Jim, one of the issues that I would like to close with in my statement is education, because its an example of the overall approach that I think is important. This race is about values, its about change, its about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that its the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesnt stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10,000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one-on-one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. Ive a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre-school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what weve been talking about. If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you cant make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you cant do education. You cant do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, two minutes.\"\"\",\"\"\" I have, I have. First question is whats in the best interests of the United States? Whats in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nations interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nations interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nations interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nations interest. Ive thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so Ive thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I havent started naming names except for one person, and thats Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. Hes a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him. Hes man of solid judgment and hes going to be a person to stand by my side. One of the things Ive done in Texas is Ive been able to put together a good team of people. Ive been able to set clear goals. The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system thats safe and secure, foreign policy thats in our nations interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. Thats what a Chief Executive Officer does. So Ive thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesnt matter who you are or how youre raised or where youre from, that you can succeed. I dont think theyll look at us with envy. It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. If were an arrogant nation, theyll resent us. If were a humble nation, but strong, theyll welcome us. And its -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and thats why we have to be humble. And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. So I dont think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are. Were a freedom-loving nation and if were an arrogant nation theyll view us that way, but if were a humble nation theyll respect us.MODERATOR: A humble nation. Yes, it does. Take, for example, Third World debt. I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions. I think, for example, if were convinced that a Third World country thats got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldnt go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes. We do have an obligation, but we cant be all things to all people. We can help build coalitions but we cant put our troops all around the world. We can lend money but we have to do it wisely. We shouldnt be lending money to corrupt officials. So we have to be guarded in our generosity. Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions. Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israels going to be our friend. Im going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think its important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Its important to be friends with people when you dont need each other so that when you do theres a strong bond of friendship. And thats going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or its unraveling, lets put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We dont know whether hes developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or theres going to be a consequence should I be the president. But its important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resoluting your determination. One of the reasons why I think its important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace is to be able to say to the Saddam Husseins of the world or the Iranians, dont dare threaten our friends. Its also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis were now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East. I do. I do think this, though. When it comes to timetables it cant be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. Its got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis. Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace thats good for both sides. And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. This current administrations worked hard to keep the parties at the table. I will try to do the same thing. But it wont be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East. Thats hard to tell. I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better. I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well. We dont know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isnt as strong as it used to be. He is a danger. We dont want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. And its going to be hard, its going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him. No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher. I think its a triumph. I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia. I supported them when they did so. I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasnt necessarily in our best interest or fit our nations strategy, and so I think its good public policy, I think it worked, and Im pleased I took -- made the decision I made. Im pleased the president made the decision he made. Because freedom to go in that part of the world, and where theres a lot of work left to be done, however. Yes, I think it is. Absolutely. I dont think he would have fallen had we not used the force. And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment. I supported the president. I thought he made the right decision to do so. I didnt think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It is important for NATO to have it work. Its important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe. And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. Now, theres more work to do. Remains to be seen, however, whether or not theres going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one. Also on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war. If I think its in our nations strategic interest Ill commit troops. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and thats why I took the position I took. I think its important for NATO to be strong and confident. I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President. Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and thats where the mission went wrong. The mission was changed. And as a result, our nation paid a price. And so I dont think our troops ought to be used for whats called nation-building. I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war. I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when its in our best interests. But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti. I wouldnt have supported either.MODERATOR: What about Lebanon?BUSH: Yes.MODERATOR: Grenada.BUSH: Yes.MODERATOR: Panama? Yes. Some of them Ive got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean. I think the administration did the right thing in that case. I do. It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but its a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda. And thats a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation. The administration, seem like were having a great love for us tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda. Well, I understand, and Africa is important. And weve got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy. We have to work with Nigeria. Thats an important continent. But theres got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere. And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we wont be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity. I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. I thought that was a good model. But we cant be all things to all people in the world, Jim. And I think thats where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. Im worried about overcommitting our military around the world. I want to be judicious in its use. You mentioned Haiti. I wouldnt have sent troops to Haiti. I didnt think it was a mission worthwhile. It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful. It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and Im not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before. First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said. I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy. And we cant do that. Weve got to rebuild our military. But one of the problems we have in the military is were in a lot of places around the world. And I mentioned one, and thats the Balkans. I would very much like to get our troops out of there. I recognize we cant do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. No one is suggesting that. But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground. And there is an example. Haiti is another example. Now there are some places where I think -- you know, Ive supported the administration in Columbia. I think its important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world. The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia. But -- I dont think so. I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. Maybe Im missing something here. I mean, were going to have kind of a nation building core from America? Absolutely not. Our military is meant to fight and win war. Thats what its meant to do. And when it gets overextended, morale drops. I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but Im going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious. Well, I mentioned Third World debt.MODERATOR: Sure. Thats a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations. I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I dont think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid. I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and theres some pretty egregious examples recently. One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didnt help the nation. I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I dont want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, well bail you out. It needs to be available for emergency situations. I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico. But I dont think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves. So Ill look at every place where were investing money. I just want to make sure the return is good. Let me comment on that. Im not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way its got to be. We can help. And maybe its just our difference in government, the way we view government. I want to empower the people. I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do. I just dont think its the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, we do it this way, so should you. I think we can help. I know weve got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces. But take Russia, for example. We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdins pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform. The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia. Theyre going to have to make the decision themselves. Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, theres a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy. But Russia has to make the decision. We can work with them on security matters, for example, but its their call to make. So Im not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, we do it this way, so should you. Now, we trust freedom. We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans. But maybe I misunderstand where youre coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course. Yeah, I cant imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed. Thats just flat wrong, and thats not what America is all about. And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling. One of my concerns, though, is I dont want to federalize the local police forces. I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs decisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job. I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they dont there needs to be a consequence at the federal level. But its very important that we not overstep our bounds and I think most people -- most police officers are good, dedicated, honorable citizens who are doing their job, putting their lives at risk who arent bigoted or arent prejudiced. I dont think they ought to be held guilty. But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done. And if you cant, there will be a federal consequence. No. Weve got one in Texas. And guess what? The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess whats going to happen to them? Theyre going to be put to death. A jury found them guilty. Its going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death. And its the right cause. Its the right decision. Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America. Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence. People are stopped, and we have to do something about that. My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect. So racial profiling isnt just an issue at local police forces. Its an issue throughout our society. And as we become a diverse society, were going to have to deal with it more and more. I believe, though -- I believe, as sure as Im sitting here, that most Americans really care. Theyre tolerant people. Theyre good, tolerant people. Its the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them. Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes. In public education when we just move children through the schools. My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here. She had one of the greatest lines of all lines. She said, reading is the new civil right. Shes right. And to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be, every single child in America must be educated. I mean every child. It starts with making sure every child learns to read. K-2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not theres a deficiency. Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum. Intensive reading laboratories, teacher retraining. I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children. We can do better in our public schools. We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim. One of the cornerstones of reform, and good reform, is to measure. Because when you measure you can ask the question, do they know? Is anybody being profiled? Is anybody being discriminated against? It becomes a tool, a corrective tool. And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning. And if they are, fine. And if theyre not, there has to be a consequence. And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education. There is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child. Well, you dont realize we have a hate crimes statute? We do. GORE No -- well, what the Vice President must not understand is weve got a hate crimes bill in Texas. And secondly, the people that murdered Mr. Byrd got the ultimate punishment. The death penalty. In this case when you murder somebody its hate, Jim. The crime is hate. And they got the ultimate punishment. Im not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty. We happen to have a statute on the books thats a hate crimes statute in Texas.GORE: May I respond?MODERATOR: Sure. I would support the Orrin Hatch version of it, not the Senator Kennedy version. But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, were happy with our laws on our books. That bill did -- there was another bill that did die in committee. But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, were going to go after all crime. And were going to make sure people get punished for the crime. And in this case we cant enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to deaths. And thats whats gonna happen in the State of Texas. Im not for gay marriage. I think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. And I appreciated the way the administration signed the Defense of Marriage Act. I presume the Vice President supported it when the President signed that bill and supports it now. But I think marriage is a sacred institution. Im going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me. Ive had a record of doing so in the State of Texas. Ive been a person that had been called a uniter, not a divider, because I accept other peoples points of view. But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? Im not sure what kind of view hes describing to me. I can just tell you, Im a person who respects other people. I respect their -- I respect -- on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesnt. Im not sure where hes coming from. But I will be a tolerant person. Ive been a tolerant person all my life. I just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman. Yes. I dont think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights. Well, I have no idea. I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I dont know the particulars of this law. I will tell you Im the kind of person, I dont hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation. As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further. I dont really think its any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life. And I think thats a private matter. And I think thats the way it ought to be. But Im going to be respectful for people, Ill tolerate people, and I support equal rights but not special rights for people. Well, it would be if theyre given special protective status. That doesnt mean we shouldnt fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States. Well, it starts with enforcing law. When you say loud and clear to somebody if youre going to carry a gun illegally, were going to arrest you. If youre going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested. If you commit a crime with a gun, there needs to be absolute certainty in the law. And that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level. Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns. And we havent done a very good job of that at the federal level recently. And Im going to make it a priority. Secondly, I dont think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldnt have them. Thats why I support instant background checks at gun shows. One of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not. In Texas I tried to do something innovative. Theres a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future. I support that. But I said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe, come and get one for free. So were distributing in our State of Texas for free. I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21. I disagree with the vice president on this issue. He is for registration of guns. I think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license -- I guess licensing like a drivers license for a gun, the only people that are going to show up are law-abiding citizens. The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D. card. Its the law-abiding citizens who will do that. An I dont think that is going to be an effective tool to make the -- keep our society safe. Well, Im not for photo licensing. Let me say something about Columbine. Listen, weve got gun laws. He says we ought to have gun-free schools. Everybody believes that. Im sure every state in the union has got them. You cant carry a gun into a school. And there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school. But Columbine spoke to a larger issue. Its really a matter of culture. Its a culture that somewhere along the line weve begun to disrespect life. Where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the Internet and walk in and decide to take somebody elses life? So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs. Some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say, we love you. So theres a -- this is a society that -- of ours thats got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong. And we can enforce law. But there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on -- not certainly only in this debate, but just in general on law. But theres a larger law. Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. And thats where our society must head if were going to be a peaceful and prosperous society. Yeah, no question about that, but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law. Some kid who feels like -- doesnt matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun. What matters is something in this persons head says there is not going to be a consequence. So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws. We added beds. Were tough. We believe in tough love. We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, youre automatically detained. And thats what needs to happen. Weve got laws. If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, thats important. Well, Ive got a plan to do something about that. Its to make health care affordable and available this way. First, theres some who should be buying health care who choose not to. Theres some -- Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say Ill never get sick, therefore I dont need health care right now. For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity. In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that cant afford it, a couple of things we need to do. One, we need more community health centers. Ive developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country. These are places where people can get primary care. Secondly -- and theyre good. Theyre very important parts of the safety net of health care. Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if youre a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets. It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system. If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the childrens health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power. And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down. I think thats the very best way to go. It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and its a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? First of all, let me say hes not for a government-run health care system? I thought thats exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system. It was fortunately stopped in its tracks. Secondly, we spend $4.7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President. It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long. But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union. And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. Weve signed up over 110,000 children to the CHIPS program. For comparable states our size, were signing them up as fast as any other state. You can quote all the numbers you want, but Im telling you we care about our people in Texas. We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and were doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured.MODERATOR: Is he right? If hes trying to allege that Im a hard-hearted person and I dont care about children, hes absolutely wrong. Weve spent $4.7 billion a year in the State of Texas for uninsured people. And they get health care. Now, its not the most efficient way to get people health care. But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased. He can make any excuse he wants, but the facts are that were reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population. And as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally, somehow the allegation that we dont care and were going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the State of Texas is totally absurd. Let me just tell you who the jury is. The people of Texas. Theres only been one governor ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms, and that was me. And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know Im a conservative person and a compassionate person. So he can throw all the kinds of numbers around. Im just telling you our state comes together to do what is right. We come together both Republicans and Democrats. First of all, thats simply not true what he just said, of course. And secondly, I repeat to you -- That we spent -- the top 1% receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending. The top -- lets talk about my tax plan. The top 1% will pay one-third of all the federal income taxes. And in return, get one-fifth of the benefits, because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. That stands in stark contrast, by the way, to a man who is going to leave 50 million -- 50 million Americans out of tax relief. We just have a different point of view. Its a totally different point of view. He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. Let me go back to Texas, for example, for a minute. We pay 4.7 billion. I cant emphasize to you how much. I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place. The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session. Were working hard to sign up children. Were doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state. Were making really good progress. And our state cares a lot about our children. My priority is going to be the health of our citizens. These folks have had eight years to get something done in Washington, D.C. on the uninsured. They have not done it. Theyve had eight years to get something done on Medicare. And they have not got it done. And my case to the American people is, if youre happy with inactivity, stay with the horse. The horse is up there now. But if you want change, you need to get somebody that knows how to bring Republicans and Democrats together to get positive things done for American. Well, let me start with Texas. We are a big industrial state. We reduced our industrial waste by 11%. We cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my states history, 450 of them. Our water is cleaner now. A brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers. And people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields dont want to do so for fear of lawsuit. I think we ought to have federal liability protection, depending upon whether or not standards have been met. The book you mentioned that Vice President Gore wrote, he also called for taxing -- big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment. And now that the energy prices are high, I guess hes not advocating those big energy taxes right now. I believe we ought to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to -- with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality. I think we need to have clean coal technologies. I propose $2 billion worth. By the way, I just found out the other day an interesting fact, that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to -- in Prudhoe Bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area. And it was a smart move because theres gas reserves up there. We need gas pipelines to bring the gas down. Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that theres mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, thats what we did in Texas. No excuses. You must conform. In other words, there are practical things we can do. But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks. If you own the land, every day is Earth Day. People care a lot about their land and care about their environment. Not all wisdom is in Washington, D.C. on this issue. Well, I dont believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C. I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels. And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I cant let him just say something and not correct it. The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President. Thats what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities. I think theres a difference. I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was -- Out in the west, yeah. And so -- on the logging issue. Thats not the way I would have done it. Perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside. But I certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before I would have acted unilaterally. Sure, absolutely, so long as theyre based upon science and theyre reasonable. So long as people have input.MODERATOR: What about global warming? I think its an issue that we need to take very seriously. But I dont think we know the solution to global warming yet. And I dont think weve got all the facts before we make decisions. I tell you one thing Im not going to do is Im not going to let the United States carry the burden for cleaning up the worlds air. Like Kyoto Treaty would have done. China and India were exempted from that treaty. I think we need to be more even-handed, as evidently 99 senators -- I think it was 99 senators supported that position. Yeah, I agree. I just -- I think there has been -- some of the scientists, I believe, Mr. Vice President, havent they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming? A profound scientist recently made a different -- Im sorry. I apologize, Mr. Vice President. Of course they care about them. Oh, you mean the rules. What the heck. I -- of course theres a lot -- look, global warming needs to be taken very seriously, and I take it seriously. But science, theres a lot -- theres differing opinions. And before we react, I think its best to have the full accounting, full understanding of whats taking place. And I think to answer your question, I think both of us care a lot about the environment. We may have different approaches. We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks. I just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input. And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place. I feel very strongly the same place. It certainly wasnt the attitude that took place out west, however. Well, we all make mistakes. Ive been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, you know, if you know what I mean. I think credibility is important. It is going to be important for the president to be credible with Congress, important for the president to be credible with foreign nations. And yes, I think its something that people need to consider. This isnt something new. I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellows name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims. I thought during his debate with Senator Bradley saying he authored the EITC when it didnt happen. I mention the last debate --MODERATOR: EITC? The Earned Income Tax Credit, sorry.MODERATOR: Thats all right. A lot of initials from a guy whos not from Washington, isnt it? Anyway, he co-sponsored McCain-Feingold, and yet he didnt. And so I think this is an issue. I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package. I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers. But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue. And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations. Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package. Thats what he said the other day, and thats simply not the case. And I have every right in the world to defend my record and positions. Thats what debates are about and thats what campaigns are about.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? Thats going to be up to the people, isnt it? Depends on what he says in the future in the campaign. I hope theyre not awful things. I think they may be using the mans own words. I dont believe Ive used those words. You havent seen the commercial?MODERATOR: Your -- Thats the kind of exaggeration I was just talking about. (LAUGHTER) Jim, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening. Im running to get some things done for America. Theres too many issues left unresolved. Theres been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in Washington, D.C. I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future. I want to have an education system that sets high standards, local control of schools and strong accountability. No child should be left behind in America. I want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace. I worry about morale in todays military. The warning signs are clear. It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure theyre housed better and have a focused mission for our military. Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare. This issue has been too long on the table because its been a political issue. Its time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage. I want to do something about Social Security. Its an important priority, because now is the time to act and were going to say to our seniors, our promises weve made to you will be promises kept. But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money. And finally, I do believe in tax relief. I believe we can set our priorities. I dont believe, like the vice president does, in huge government. I believe in limited government. By having a limited government and a focused government, we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills. I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can. Thank you for listening. Im asking for your vote, and God bless.\"\"\",\"\"\" Should the people of the world look at the United States, Governor, and say, should they fear us, should they welcome our involvement, should they see us as a friend, everybody in the world? How would you project us around the world, as president? Does that give us -- does our wealth, our good economy, our power, bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world? Lets go through some of the specifics now. New question. Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East. Here were talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there? So you dont believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides and resolve this right now? A lot of people pushing hey, the United States should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation. You agree with that, Governor? People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy, and they are so interested they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle Middle East policy. Is there any difference? Saddam Hussein, you mean, get him out of there? You feel that is a failure of the Clinton administration?BUSH: I do. Did he state your position correctly, youre not calling for eliminating the sanctions, are you? Lets go on to Milosevic and Yugoslavia, and it falls under the area of our military power. Governor, new question. Should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. military intervention? But you think it would not have happened -- do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a legitimate use of our military power? Trying to figure out who the questioner was. Well, lets stay on the subject for a moment. New question related to this. I figured this out; in the last 20 years there have been eight major actions that involved the introduction of U.S. ground, air or naval forces. Let me name them. Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo. If you had been president for any of those interventions, would any of those interventions not have happened? We talked about that. Want me to do it with you? Lebanon.BUSH: Make a couple comments.MODERATOR: Sure, absolutely, sure. Somalia. I do, I do. The Persian Gulf, obviously. And Bosnia. And you have already talked about Kosovo. But the reverse side of the question, Governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. There was no U.S. intervention, no intervention from the outside world. Was that a mistake not to intervene? Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide? So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 peoples lives are at risk? Vice President Gore, do you agree with the governors views on nation building, the use of military, our military, for nation building as he described and defined it? You said in the Boston debate, Governor, on this issue of nation building, that the United States military is overextended now. Where is it overextended? Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you become president? The use of the military, there -- some people are now suggesting that if you dont want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that? Is that on your radar screen? In the non-military area of influencing events around the world, the financial and economic are, the World Bank President Wilfinson said recently, Governor, that U.S. contributions to overseas development assistance is lower now almost than it has ever been. Is that a problem for you? Do you think -- what is your -- what is your idea about what the United States obligations are? Im talking about financial assistance and that sort of thing to other countries, the poor countries. Do you think were meeting our obligations properly? Lets move on. No, lets move on. First, a couple of follow-ups from the vice presidential debate last week. Vice President Gore, would you support or sign, as president, a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government? And that could be a federal law?BUSH: Yeah.MODERATOR: And you would agree? You have a different view of that.BUSH: No, I dont, really.MODERATOR: On hate crimes laws? What -- if you become president, Governor, are there other areas, racial problem areas, that you would deal with as president involving discrimination? Like you said, Arab-Americans, but also Hispanics, Asians, as well as Blacks in this country. Vice President Gore, what would be on your racial discrimination elimination list as president? Hold on one second. What is the misunderstanding? Lets clear this up. They were prosecuted under the murder laws, were they not, in Texas? And you would support that bill.GORE: Absolutely. Would you support a national hate crimes law? New subject, new question. Another vice presidential debate follow-up. Governor, both Senator Lieberman and Secretary Cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships. Whats your position on that? Do you believe in general terms that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as other Americans? Well, but its a logical response. Special rights, how does that affect gays and lesbians? New subject, new question, Vice President Gore. How do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns? All right. So on guns, somebody wants to cast a vote based on your differences, where are the differences? Excuse me, you would have to get the license -- a photo I.D. to go in and before you could buy the gun?GORE: Correct. All right. Who would issue the -- Back to the question about the differences on gun control. What are they, Governor, from your point of view, between you and the Vice President? New question. As I was saying. Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors. What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now? What would you do about that? Some of the 40 million. Governor, did the -- are the vice presidents figures correct about Texas? Lets let the governor respond to that. Are those numbers correct? Are his charges correct? Let me put that directly to you, Vice President Gore. The reason you brought this up, is it -- are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way Governor Bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president? What is not true, Governor? New question, new subject. Vice President Gore, on the environment. In your 1992 book you said, quote, We must make the rescue of our environment the central organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet. Do you still feel that way? Explain what a brown field is to those who dont follow this. Where do you see the basic difference in very simple terms in two or three sentences between you and the governor on the environment? If a voter wants to make a choice, what is it? Would you say its a fundamental difference? Weve talked about supply. I just want to know for somebody -- were getting close to the end of our time here. If somebody wanted to vote on the environment, how would you draw the differences, Governor? That was out in the west? Would you believe the federal government still has some new rules and new regulations and new laws to pass in the environmental area or do you think -- Global warming, the Senate did turn it down. I think --BUSH: 99 to nothing. Both of you have now violated -- excuse me. Both of you have now violated your own rules. Hold that thought. I know, I know. But under your alls rules you are not allowed to ask each other a question. I let you do it a moment ago.BUSH: Twice. Now you just -- twice, sorry. (LAUGHTER) Thats an interruption, okay. But anyhow, you just did it so now -- You arent allowed to do that either, see? (LAUGHTER) Im sorry, go ahead and finish your thought. People care about these things Ive found out. Yeah, right, exactly right. Go ahead. New question. Last question. For you, Governor. And this flows somewhat out of the Boston debate. You, your running mate, your campaign officials have charged that Vice President Gore exaggerates, embellishes and stretches the facts, etcetera. Are you -- do you believe these are serious issues? This is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on November 7? Does that resolve the issue, Governor? Does it resolve it for you? Your folks are saying some awful things. Well, what I mean is calling him a serial exaggerator -- No, but your campaign ads.BUSH: Maybe they have. And your campaign officials have. And your campaign officials, Mr. Vice President, are now calling the governor a bumbler.BUSH: Wait a minute. (LAUGHTER) I mean, my point is, should this -- is this -- Gentlemen, its time to go to the closing statements. And Vice President Gore, you have two minutes. And we will return next Tuesday night, October 17th, from Washington University in St. Louis for the third and final debate. Thank you, Vice President Gore, Governor Bush. See you next week. For now, from Winston-Salem, Im Jim Lehrer, thank you and good night.(APPLAUSE)\"\"\"\n",
      "October 3 2000 ,AL GORE,GEORGE BUSH,\"\"\" Well, Jim, first of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of this debate and the people of Boston for hosting the debate. I would like to thank Governor Bush for participating, and I would like to say Im happy to be here with Tipper and our family. I have actually not questioned Governor Bushs experience. I have questioned his proposals. And here is why. I think this is a very important moment for our country. We have achieved extraordinary prosperity. And in this election, America has to make an important choice. Will we use our prosperity to enrich not just the few, but all of our families? I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices. If Im entrusted with the presidency, here are the choices that I will make. I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them. And I will cut taxes for middle-class families. I believe its important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus. If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people. If Im entrusted with the presidency, I will help parents and strengthen families because, you know, if we have prosperity that grows and grows, we still wont be successful unless we strengthen families by, for example, ensuring that children can always go to schools that are safe. By giving parents the tools to protect their children against cultural pollution. I will make sure that we invest in our country and our families. And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security. That is my agenda and that is why I think that its not just a question of experience. Yes, Jim. I said that his tax cut plan, for example, raises the question of whether its the right choice for the country. And let me give you an example of what I mean. Under Governor Bushs tax cut proposal, he would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, health care, prescription drug and national defense all combined. Now, I think those are the wrong priorities. Now, under my proposal, for every dollar that I propose in spending for things like education and health care, I will put another dollar into middle class tax cuts. And for every dollar that I spend in those two categories, Ill put $2 toward paying down the national debt. I think its very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it. And I also think its very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform. Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half. I fought hard from my days in the Senate and as vice president to cut the welfare rolls and weve moved millions of people in America into good jobs. But its now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers. Jim, if I could just respond. I know that. The governor used the phrase phony numbers, but if you look at the plan and add the numbers up, these numbers are correct. He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drug, education and national defense all combined. I agree that the surplus is the American peoples money, its your money. Thats why I dont think we should give nearly half of it to the wealthiest 1%, because the other 99% have had an awful lot to do with building the surplus in our prosperity. Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare. The governor has described Medicare as a government HMO. Its not, and let me explain the difference. Under the Medicare prescription drug proposal Im making, here is how it works, you go to your own doctor. Your doctor chooses your prescription. No HMO or insurance company can take those choices away from you. Then you go to your own pharmacy. You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost. If youre in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector. Now here is the contrast. 95% of all seniors would get no help whatsoever under my opponents plan for the first four or five years. Now, one thing I dont understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny? If I could respond to that. Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare. The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it. I would be interested to see if he would say this evening hell put Medicare in a lockbox. $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut. Now here is the difference. Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts. Under the governors plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that hes modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries. Let me give you one quick example. There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee. Hes 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble. They have an income of $25,000 a year. They cant pay for their prescription drugs. Theyre some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs. Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away. Under Governor Bushs plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions. They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible. Its just clear you can go to the website and look. If you make more than $25,000 a year you dont get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then youre pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and theres no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions. And the insurance companies say it wont work and they wont offer these plans. The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%. Let me call your attention to the key word there. He said all poor seniors. Its a two-phase plan. For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered. Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years. Excellent question. And here is the simple difference. My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component. And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side. Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price. And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy. And domestic sources that are cleaner and better. And Im proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that dont have as much pollution, that dont burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs. Because, when we sell these new products here, well then be able to sell them overseas. There is a ravenous demand for them overseas. Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there. I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months worth of oil and the oil wouldnt start flowing for many years into the future. I dont think its a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of Americas environment. We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology. Let me clarify. Im for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side. Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bushs answer that we certainly agree on, and thats the low income heating assistance program. I commend you for supporting that. I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago. And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast. Now, as for the proposals that Ive worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies for the last few years in the Congress, weve faced a lot of opposition to them. Theyve only approved about 10% of the agenda Ive helped to send up there. We need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil. I found a couple of other things we agree upon. We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize. I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology. I made a proposal three months ago on this. And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country. We dont have to do that. Thats the wrong choice. I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing to do. Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision. They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug. This is indeed a very important issue. First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a womans life or to act if her health is severely at risk. Thats not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a womans right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice group that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a womans right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies. And I think a womans right to choose ought to be protected and defended. Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it. And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision. Now that sounds to me a little bit different. I just think that we ought to support the decision. We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome. I dont favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution. And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history. And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment. And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Its very clear to me. I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think will be quite likely would uphold Roe v. Wade. It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade. I do believe its wrong to use a litmus test. If you look at the history of a lower court judges rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how theyll interpret questions. A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue. Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost. It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it. Well, Milosevic has lost the election. His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election. Its overwhelming. Milosevics government refuses to release the vote count. Theres now a general strike going on. Theyre demonstrating. I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election. The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office. Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote. Now, weve made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world. That is a very strong incentive that weve given them to do the right thing. Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions. Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they dont like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there. So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it. But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done. And I hope that hell be out of office very shortly.MODERATOR: Governor Bush, one minute. In this particular situation, no. Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now. And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power. Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea. But being as they have not yet been willing to recognize Kostunica as the lawful winner of the election, Im not sure its right for us to invite the president of Russia to mediate this -- this dispute there because we might not like the results that comes out of that. They currently favor going forward with a runoff election. I think thats the wrong thing. I think the governors instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there. But I think we need to be very careful in the present situation before we invite the Russians to play the lead role in mediating. I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world. Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries. If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world. In fact, in my ten-year budget proposal Ive set aside more than twice as much for this purpose as Governor Bush has in his proposal. Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country. But if our national security is at stake, if we have allies, if weve tried every other course, if were sure military action will succeed, and if the costs are proportionate to the benefits, we should get involved. Now, just because we dont want to get involved everywhere doesnt mean we should back off anywhere it comes up. I disagree with the proposal that maybe only when oil supplies are at stake that our national security is at risk. I think that there are situations like in Bosnia or Kosovo where theres a genocide, where our national security is at stake there. Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds. When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army. I served my country in Vietnam. My father was a senator who strongly opposed the Vietnam War. I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did. But I went anyway because I knew if I didnt, somebody else in the small town of Carthage, Tennessee, would have to go in my place. I served for eight years in the House of Representatives and I served on the Intelligence Committee, specialized in looking at arms control. I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. For the last eight years Ive served on the National Security Council, and when the conflict came up in Bosnia, I saw a genocide in the heart of Europe with the most violent war on the continent of Europe since World War II. Look, thats where World War I started. My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there. Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict. We have to be willing to make good, sound judgments. Incidentally, I know the value of making sure our troops have the latest technology. The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons. I think thats a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge. If I could say one thing. One of the key points in foreign policy and national security policy is the need to establish the old-fashioned principle that politics ought to stop at the waters edge. When I was in the United States Congress, I worked with former President Reagan. When I was in the United States Senate I worked with former President Bush, your father. I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War. I think bipartisanship is a national asset. We have to find ways to reestablish it in foreign policy and national security policy. Oh, absolutely. This is a very important moment in the history of our country. Look, weve got the biggest surpluses in all of American history. The key question that has to be answered in this election is will we use that prosperity wisely in a way that benefits all of our people and doesnt go just to the few. Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bushs plan, go to the wealthiest 1%. I think we have to make the right and responsible choices. I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies. I think that we have to help parents and strengthen families by dealing with the kind of inappropriate entertainment material that families are just heart sick that their children are exposed to. I think weve got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage. I think that we have got to balance the budget every single year, pay down the national debt and, in fact, under my proposal the national debt will be completely eliminated by the year 2012. I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I dont think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. Ill veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare. Now, the priorities are just very different. Ill give you a couple of examples. For every new dollar that I propose for spending on health care, Governor Bush spends $3 for a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Now, for every dollar that I propose to spend on education, he spends $5 on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1%. Those are very clear differences.MODERATOR: Governor, one minute. You havent heard the governor deny these numbers. Hes called them phony and fuzzy. The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here? No, I dont, and Im not going to go to calling names on his facts. Im just gonna tell you what the real facts are. The analysis that hes talking about leaves out more than half of the tax cuts that I have proposed. And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasnt denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for all his other things combined. Now those are the wrong priorities. $665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%. As I said, almost 30% of it goes to Americans that make more than $1 million per year. Every middle class family is eligible for a tax cut under my proposal. Let me give you some specific examples. I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college. I believe all senior citizens should be able to choose their own doctors and get prescription drugs from their own pharmacists with Medicare paying half the bill. I believe parents need more public and charter school choice to send their kids to a safe school. We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are. And thats why I have made it a number one priority in my budget. We agree on a couple of things on education. I strongly support new accountability, so does Governor Bush. I strongly support local control, so does Governor Bush. Im in favor of testing as a way of measuring performance. Every school and every school district, have every state test the children. Ive also proposed a voluntary national test in the fourth grade and eighth grade, and a form of testing the governor has not endorsed. I think that all new teachers ought to be tested, including in the subjects that they teach. Weve got to recruit 100,000 new teachers. And I have budgeted for that. Weve got to reduce the class size so that the student who walks in has more one-on-one time with the teacher. We ought to have universal pre-school and we ought to make college tuition tax deductible, up to $10,000 a year. I would like to tell you a quick story. I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida. Im here with a group of 13 people from around the country who helped me prepare. We had a great time. Two days ago we ate lunch at a restaurant. The guy that served us lunch gave me a letter today. His name is Randy Ellis. He has a 15-year-old daughter named Caley, who is in Sarasota High School. Her science class was supposed to be for 24 students. Shes the 36th student in that classroom. They sent me a picture of her in the classroom. They cant squeeze another desk in for her, so she has to stand during class. I want the federal government, consistent with local control and new accountability, to make improvement of our schools the number one priority so Caley will have a desk and can sit down in a classroom where she can learn. First of all, I do have mandatory testing. I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly. The voluntary national testing is in addition to the mandatory testing that we require of states. All schools, all school districts, students themselves, and required teacher testing, which goes a step farther than Governor Bush has been willing to go. Here are a couple of differences, though, Jim. Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and dont have to take all applicants. Now, private schools play a great role in our society. All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools. But I dont think private schools should have a right to take taxpayer money away from public schools at a time when Caley Ellis is standing in that classroom. Let me give you another example. I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9MODERATOR: Wait a minute, Governor. When the action in Kosovo was dragging on and we were searching for a solution to the problem, our country had defeated the adversary on the battlefield without a single American life being lost in combat. But the dictator Milosevic was hanging on. I invited the former prime minister of Russia to my house and took a risk in asking him to get personally involved, along with the head of Finland, to go to Belgrade and to take a set of proposals from the United States that would constitute basically a surrender by Serbia. But it was a calculated risk that paid off. Now, I could probably give you some other examples of decisions over the last 24 years. I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim. And throughout all that time the people I have fought for have been the middle-class families, and I have been willing to stand up to powerful interests like the big insurance companies, the drug companies, the HMOs, the oil companies. They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power. I cast my lot with the people even when it means that you have to stand up to some powerful interests who are trying to turn the -- the policies and the laws to their advantage. You can see it in this campaign. The big drug companies support Governor Bushs prescription drug proposal. They oppose mine because they dont want to get Medicare involved because theyre afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.MODERATOR: Governor Bush? First I want to compliment the governor on his response to those fires and floods in Texas. I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out. And FEMA has been a major flagship project of our reinventing government efforts. And I agree, it works extremely well now. On the international financial crises that come up, my friend, Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of Treasury is here, hes a close advisor to me and great friend in all respects. I have had a chance to work with him and Allen Greenspan and others on the crisis following the collapse of the Mexican peso. When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euros value has been dropping, but seems to be under control. But it started for me in the last eight years when I had the honor of casting the tie-breaking vote to end the old economic plan here at home and put into place a new economic plan that has helped us to make some progress, 22 million new jobs, the greatest prosperity ever. But its not good enough. My attitude is you aint seen nothing yet. We need to do more and better. Can I comment on that?MODERATOR: You may. You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have. Its their ingenuity, I agree with that. But you know, they were working pretty hard eight years ago. And now they had ingenuity eight years ago. The difference is weve got a new policy. And instead of concentrating on tax cuts mostly for the wealthy, we want -- I want tax cuts for the middle-class families and I want to continue the prosperity and make sure that it enriches not just a few but all of our families. We have gone from the biggest deficits to the biggest surpluses. We have gone from a triple debt recession during the previous 12 years to a tripling in the stock market. Instead of a high unemployment, we have the lowest African-American and Latin American unemployment rates in history and 22 million new jobs. Its not good enough. Too many people have been left behind. We have got to do much more. The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security. And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security. Im opposed to diverting one out of every six dollars out of the Social Security trust fund, as the Governor has proposed, into the stock market. I want new incentives for savings and investment for the young couples who are working hard so they can save and invest on their own on top of Social Security, not at the expense of Social Security, as the governor proposes. If I could respond, Jim. What hes quoting is not the Senate Budget Commiitte, it is a partisan press release by the Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee thats not worth the government -- the taxpayer-paid paper that its printed on. Now, as for 20,000 new bureaucrats, as you call them, you know, the size of the federal government will go down in a Gore administration. In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers. It is 300,000 people smaller today than it was eight years ago. Now, the fact is youre going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today. But thats not the question. The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today? And as for the surest way to threaten our prosperity, having a $1.9 trillion tax cut, almost half of which goes to the wealthy, and a $1 trillion Social Security privatization proposal is the surest way to put our budget into deficit -- I do disagree. Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses. Here is my plan. I will keep Social Security in a lockbox and that pays down the national debt. And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security. That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years. Now, I think that its very important to understand that cutting benefits under Social Security means that people like Winifred Skinner from Des Moines, Iowa, who is here, would really have a much harder time. Because there are millions of seniors who are living almost hand to mouth. And you talk about cutting benefits. I dont go along with it. I am opposed to it. Im also opposed to a plan that diverts 1 out of every $6 away from the Social Security Trust Fund. Social Security is a trust fund that pays the checks this year with the money that is paid into Social Security this year. The governor wants to divert 1 out of every $6 off into the stock market, which means that he would drain a trillion dollars out of the Social Security Trust Fund in this generation over the next ten years, and Social Security under that approach would go bankrupt within this generation. His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing. It would borrow up to $3 trillion. Now, Social Security has never done that. And I dont think it should do that. I think it should stay in a lockbox, and Ill tell you this. I will veto anything that takes money out of Social Security for privatization or anything else other than Social Security. Here is the difference. I give a new incentive for younger workers to save their own money and invest their own money, but not at the expense of Social Security, on top of Social Security. My plan is Social Security plus. The governors plan is Social Security minus. Your future benefits would be cut by the amount thats diverted into the stock market. If you make bad investments, thats too bad. But even before then the problem hits because the money contributed to Social Security this year is an entitlement. Thats how it works. And the money is used to pay the benefits for seniors this year. If you cut the amount going in 1 out of every $6, then you have to cut the value of each check by 1 out of every $6 unless you come up with the money from somewhere else. I would like to know from the governor -- I know were not supposed to ask each other questions -- but Id be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget? Could I respond to that, Jim? This is a big issue. Could we do another round on it? Just briefly. When FDR established Social Security, they didnt call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States. If you dont have trust in that, I do. If you take it out of the surplus in the trust fund, that means the trust fund goes bankrupt in this generation within 20 years. I think we ought to attack our countrys problems, not attack each other. I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person. You may want to focus on scandal. I want to focus on results. As I said a couple of months ago, I stand here as my own man and I want you to see me for who I really am. Tipper and I have been married for 30 years. We became grandparents a year-and-a-half ago. Weve got four children. I have devoted 24 years of my life to public service and Ive said this before and Ill say it again, if you entrust me with the presidency, I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will work hard for you every day. I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down. No. I think the American people should take into account who we are as individuals, what our experience is, what our positions are on the issues and proposals are. Im asking you to see me for who I really am. Im offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals. And incidentally, one of them is this. This current campaign financing system has not reflected credit on anybody in either party. And thats one of the reasons Ive said before, and Ill pledge here tonight, if Im president, the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I will send to the United States Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. And the reason its that important is that all of the other issues, whether prescription drugs for all seniors that are opposed by the drug companies or the patients bill of rights to take the decisions away from the HMOs and give them to the doctors and nurses, opposed by the HMOs and insurance companies, all these other proposals are going to be a lot easier to get passed for the American people if we limit the influence of special interest money and give democracy back to the American people. And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill. Look, Governor Bush, you have attacked my character and credibility and I am not going to respond in kind. I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other. One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money. We have to get a handle on it. And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and its not a new position for me. 24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections. And anybody who thinks Im just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress. I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law. I want to thank everybody who watched and listened tonight because this is indeed a crucial time in American history. Were at a fork in the road. We have this incredible prosperity, but a lot of people have been left behind. And we have a very important decision to make. Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few? One important way of looking at this is to ask who are you going to fight for? Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families. Why? Because you are the ones who have the hardest time paying taxes, the hardest time making ends meet. You are the ones who are making car payments and mortgage payments and doing right by your kids. And a lot of times there are powerful forces that are against you. Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you. I know one thing about the position of president, its the only position in our Constitution that is filled by an individual who is given the responsibility to fight not just for one state or one district or the well-connected or wealthy, but to fight for all of the people, including especially those who most need somebody who will stand up and take on whatever powerful forces might stand in the way. There is a woman named Winifred Skinner here tonight from Iowa. I mentioned her earlier. Shes 79 years old. She has Social Security. Im not going to cut her benefits or support any proposal that would. She gets a small pension, but in order to pay for her prescription drug benefits, she has to go out seven days a week several hours a day picking up cans. She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight. I want to tell her, Ill fight for a prescription drug benefit for all seniors and fight for the people of this country for a prosperity that benefits all.\"\"\",\"\"\" Well, we do come from different places. I come from being a West Texas. The governor is the chief executive officer. We know how to set agendas as a governor. I think youll find the difference reflected in our budgets. I want to take one-half of the surplus and dedicate it to Social Security. One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills. I want everybody who pays taxes to have their tax rates cut. And that stands in contrast to my worthy opponents plan, which will increase the size of government dramatically. His plan is three times larger than President Clintons proposed plan eight years ago. It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats. It it empowers Washington. My vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives. Let me just say that obviously tonight were going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do. People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion. And my plan say why dont we pass 1.3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills? Surely we can afford 5% of the $25 trillion that are coming into the treasury to the hard working people that pay the bills. There is a difference of opinion. My opponent thinks the government -- the surplus is the governments money. Thats not what I think. I think its the hard-working people of Americas money and I want to share some of that money with you so you have more money to build and save and dream for your families. Its a difference of opinion. Its a difference between government making decisions for you and you getting more of your money to make decisions for yourself. Yes. I take him for his word. Look, I fully recognize Im not of Washington. Im from Texas. And hes got a lot of experience, but so do I. And Ive been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union. I have a proud record of working with both Republicans and Democrats, which is what our nation needs. Somebody that can come to Washington and say lets forget all the finger pointing and get positive things done on Medicare, prescription drugs, Social Security, and so I take him for his word. Actually what Ive said, Jim. Ive said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors. And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now theyre campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they cant get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but its time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what Ive said is that theres been some missed opportunities. Theyve had a chance. Theyve had a chance to form consensus. Ive go a plan on Medicare, for example, thats a two-stage plan that says well have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediately Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if youre happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But were going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head for political purposes, this year its time to get it done once and for all. Thats what Ive been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure theres a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear Ill trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that theyll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington.MODERATOR: One minute rebuttal. I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare. Trying to frighten people into the voting booth. Its not what I think and its not my intentions and not my plan. I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare. We need to reform Medicare. This administration has failed to do it. Seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options. The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intent of the current system. If youre happy with the system you can stay in it. There are a lot of procedures that havent kept up in Medicare with the current times. No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care. We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision. We ought to give seniors more options. I believe we ought to make the system work better. I know this. I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, lets come together. Youve had your chance, Vice President, youve been there for eight years and nothing has been done. My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years. My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C. Its going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide. I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, if were going to scare you in the voting booth. Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs. Its called Immediate Helping Hand. Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help. Let me say something.MODERATOR: Your -- Look, this is a man who has great numbers. He talks about numbers. Im beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator. Its fuzzy math. Its a scaring -- hes trying to scare people in the voting booth. Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third. The federal government should take no more than a third of anybodys check. But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%. Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder. If youre a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay. Its from $4000 to about $2000. Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf. Thats totally false for him to stand up here and say that. Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear. They have had their chance to get something done. Im going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system. All seniors will be covered, all seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, well have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years. Wait a minute. All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.GORE: In the first year? If we can get it done in the first year, you bet. Its an issue I know a lot about. I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas. This is an administration thats had no plan. And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America. First and foremost we have to fully fund -- heat which is a way to help low income people in the east to pay for high fuel bills. We need an active exploration incentive in America. We need to explore at home. You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska. When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day. Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein. I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, have it come from our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein. I want to develop the coal resources in America. Have clean coal technologies. We better start exploring it or otherwise well be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude. Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years. The difference is we need to explore at home. And the vice president doesnt believe in exploration, for example, in Alaska. Theres a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline. Theres an interesting issue up in the northwest as well. Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy? Im against removing dams in the northwest. We need to keep that in line. I was in coal country in West Virginia. There is an abundant supply of coal in this country. I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies. Im going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world. In the short-term we need to get after it here in America. We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production. We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together. I brought this up recently with the newly elected president in Mexico, hes a man I know from Mexico. I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil. Its a major problem facing America. The administration did not deal with it. Its time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem. Its the right thing for the consumers. Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers. And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way. I dont think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and Im worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and its a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those women all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. It is an issue that will require a new attitude. Weve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbors life with a gun will understand that thats not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? I dont think a president can unilaterally overturn it. The FDA has made its decision. I think once a decision has been made, its been made unless its proven to be unsafe to women. I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug. The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue. Voters will know Ill put competent judges on the bench. People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench for writing social policy. That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me. I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government. That theyre appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred. They shouldnt misuse their bench. I dont believe in liberal activist judges. I believe in strict constructionists. Those are the kind of judges I will appoint. Ive named four in the State of Texas and ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations. Theyre good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas. It sounds like hes not very right tonight. I just told you the criteria on which Ill appoint judges. I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas. Thats what a governor gets to do. A governor gets to name supreme court judges. He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan. I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it. Ill tell you what kind of judges hell put on. Hell put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, thats what hell do. Well, Im pleased with the results of the election. As the vice president said, its time for the man to go. It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO. Thats why its important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic. But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well. Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that its in his best interest and his countrys best interest. The Russians have sway in that part of the world. We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold. Its an encouraging election. Its time for the man to leave. Well obviously we wouldnt use the Russians if they didnt agree with our answer, Mr. Vice President. Let me say this to you, I wouldnt use force. I wouldnt use force.MODERATOR: You wouldnt use force?BUSH: No.MODERATOR: Why not? Its not in our national interest to use force. I would use pressure and diplomacy. There is a difference what the president did in Kosovo and this. Its up to the people in this region to take control of their country. Well, if its in our vital national interest, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened. That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force. Secondly, whether or not the mission was clear. Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be. Thirdly, whether or not we were prepared and trained to win. Whether or not our forces were of high morale and high standing and well-equipped. And finally, whether or not there was an exit strategy. I would take the use of force very seriously. I would be guarded in my approach. I dont think we can be all things to all people in the world. I think weve got to be very careful when we commit our troops. The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops. He believes in nation building. I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders. I believe the role of the military is to fight and win war and therefore prevent war from happening in the first place. So I would take my responsibility seriously. And it starts with making sure we rebuild our military power. Morale in todays military is too low. Were having trouble meeting recruiting goals. We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals. Some of our troops are not well-equipped. I believe were overextended in too many places. And therefore I want to rebuild the military power. It starts with a billion dollar pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform. A billion dollars more than the president recently signed into law. Its to make sure our troops are well-housed and well-equipped. Bonus plans to keep some of our high-skilled folks in the services and a commander in chief that sets the mission to fight and win war and prevent war from happening in the first place. I agree our military is the strongest in the world today, thats not the question. The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come? Everywhere I go on the campaign trail I see moms and dads whose son or daughter may wear the uniform and they tell me about how discouraged their son or daughter may be. A recent poll was taken among 1,000 enlisted personnel, as well as officers, over half of whom will leave the service when their time of enlistment is up. The captains are leaving the service. There is a problem. And its going to require a new commander in chief to rebuild the military power. I was honored to be flanked by Colin Powell and General Norman Schwartzkopf recently stood by me side and agreed with me. If we dont have a clear vision of the military, if we dont stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building missions, then were going to have a serious problem coming down the road, and Im going to prevent that. Im going to rebuild our military power. Its one of the major priorities of my administration. I think youve got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office. Whether or not its -- the same in domestic policy as well. Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow? Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls or focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is. We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today. We need decisions made on sound principles. Ive been the governor of a big state. I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that Ive had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats. I think thats an important part of leadership. I think what it means to build consensus. Ive shown I know how to do so. Tonight in the audience theres one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state-wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to -- because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead. And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and whos shown the ability to get things done? Yeah. Why havent they done it in seven years? The man is practicing fuzzy math again. Theres differences. Under Vice President Gores plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965. Were talking about a massive government, folks. Were talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats. Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans. There is a huge difference in this campaign. He says hes going to give you tax cuts. 50 million of you wont receive it. He said in his speech he wants to make sure the right people get tax relief. Thats not the role of a president to decide right and wrong. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay more tax, the poorest of Americans, six million families, wont pay any tax at all. Its a huge difference. A difference between big exploding federal government that wants to think on your behalf and a plan that meets priorities and liberates working people to be able to make decisions on your own. Let me tell you what the facts are. The facts are after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes of the percentage of the whole than they do today. Secondly, if youre a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut. Let me give you one example. A family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day. They make $51,000 combined income, they pay about $3500 in taxes. Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief. Under Vice President Gores plan, they get $145 of tax relief. Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence. You ask whose plan makes more sense. There is a difference of opinion. He would rather spend the familys $1800 and I would rather the family spend that money. Let me talk about tax cuts one more time. It excludes 50 million Americans.GORE: Not so. The marriage penalty. If you itemize your tax return, you get no marriage penalty relief. He picks and chooses. He decides who the right people are. Its a fundamental difference of opinion. I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time. Well spend $25 trillion -- well collect $25 trillion in revenue in the next 10 years and spend $21 trillion. We need to send 5% back to you that pay the bills. I want to say something. This man has been disparaging my plan with all this Washington fuzzy math. If youre a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right. My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful. Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief. We can make a huge difference by saying if you receive federal money we expect you to show results. Let me give you a story about public education, if I might. Its about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas. A charter school run by some people from Teach For America. Young folks saying Im going to do something good for my country. I want to teach. A guy named Michael runs the school. It is a school full of so-called at-risk children. Its how wer unfortunately label certain children. Basically it means they cant learn. Its a school of strong discipline and high standards. Its one of the best schools in Houston. Here are the key ingredients. High expectations, strong accountabily. What Michael says, dont put all these rules on us, just let us teach and hold us accountable for every grade. Thats what we do. And as a result, these mainly Hispanic youngsters are some of the best learners in Houston, Texas. Thats my vision for public education all around America. Many of you viewers dont know, but Laura and I sent our girls to public school. They went to Austin High School. And many of the public schools are meeting the call. But, unfortunately, a lot of schools are trapping children in schools that just wont teach and wont change. Here is the role of the federal government. One is to change Head Start to a reading program. Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so. The goal is for every single child to learn to Read. there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools available. We have to consolidate the system to free the schools and encourage innovators. Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers. Four, were going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade. Show us if they are learning to read, write, add and subtract there will be bonus plans. If not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to -- the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school. What I care about is children. And so does Michael Feinberg. And you know what? It can happen in America with the right kind of leadership. The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gores plan. He says hes for voluntary testing. You cant have voluntary testing. You must have mandatory testing. You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. Thats the difference. You may claim youve got mandatory testing but you dont, Mr. Vice President. Thats a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because its the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? Weve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. Were going to ask you to show us whether or not -- we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that wont teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts. Something that my vice presidential running mate supports. Theres big differences. He wont support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money. Okay. First of all, most of this is at the state level. See, here is the mentality. Im going to make the state do this and make the state do that. All Im saying is if you spend money, show us results and test every year, which you do not do, Mr. Vice President. You dont test every year. You can say you do to the cameras but you dont, unless youve changed your plan.GORE: I didnt say that. You need to test every year. Thats why you determine if children are progressing to excellence. Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed. More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind. Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you? If youre 10 well put you here, 12 you put here. Start asking the question, what do you know? If you dont know what youre supposed to know, well make sure you do early before its too late. Ive been standing up to big business, Hollywood, big trial lawyers. Was -- the question about emergencies, wasnt it? MODERATOR You know, as governor, one of the things you have to deal with is catastrophe. I can remember the fires that swept Parker County, Texas. I remember the floods that swept our state. I remember going down to Del Rio, Texas. I have to pay the administration a compliment. James Lee Witt of FEMA has done a really good job of working with governors during times of crisis. But thats the time when youre tested not only -- its the time to test your metal, a time to test your heart when you see people whose lives have been turned upside down. It broke my heart to go to the flood scene in Del Rio where a fellow and his family got completely uprooted. The only thing I knew was to got aid as quickly as possible with state and federal help, and to put my arms around the man and his family and cry with them. Thats what governors do. They are often on the front line of catastrophic situations. Well, it depends, obviously. But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Allen Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances. I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home. I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation. And I would come up with a game plan to deal with it. Thats what governors end up doing. We end up being problem solvers. We come up with practical, common sense solutions for problems that were confronted with. In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? No, theres no difference on that. There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant. I think the economy has meant more for the Gore and Clinton folks than the Gore and Clinton folks have meant for the economy. I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and thats the role of goverment to encourage that. In terms of in response to the question, no. Two points. One, a lot of folks are still waiting for that 1992 middle-class tax cut. I remember the vice president saying, Just give us a chance to get up there, were going to make sure you get tax cuts. It didnt happen. Now hes having to say that again. Theyve had their chance to deliver a tax cut to you. Secondly, the surest way to bust this economy is to increase the role and size of the federal budget. The Senate Budget Committee did a study of the vice presidents expenditures. Its been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion. That means hell either have to raise your taxes by $900 billion or go into the Social Security surplus for $900 billion. This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people. His targeted tax cut is so detailed, so much fine print that it is going to require numerous IRS agents. We need somebody to simplify the code, to be fair, to continue prosperity by sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic ladder. I cant let the man continue with fuzzy math. It is 1.3 trillion. It will go to everybody who pays taxes. Im not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you dont. Im not going to be a picker and chooser. What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief. I thought it was interesting that on the two minutes he spent about a million-and-a-half on my plan, which means he doesnt want you to know what hes doing is loading up IOUs for future generations. He puts no real assets into the Social Security system. The revenues exceed the expenses in Social Security until the year 2015 which means all retirees are going to get the promises made. For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear. A promise made will be a promise kept. You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money. Thats the difference of opinion. The vice president thinks its the governments money. The payroll taxes are your money. You ought to put it in prudent, safe investments so that $1 trillion over the next ten years grows to be $3 trillion. The money stays within the Social Security system. Its a part of the Social Security system. He claims it will be out of Social Security. Its your money, its a part of your retirement benefit. Its a fundamental difference between what we believe. I want you to have your own asset that you can call your own. That you can pass on from one generation to the next. I want to get a better rate of return for your own money than the paltry 2% that the current Social Security Trust gets today. Mr. Greenspan I thought missed an opportunity to say theres a third way, and that is to get a better rate of return on the Social Security monies coming into the trust. There is $2.3 trillion of surplus that we can use to make sure that younger workers have a Social Security plan in the future. If were smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest. No. Theres enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security. The trillion comes from the surplus. Surplus is money -- more money than needed. Let me tell you what your plan is. Its not Social Security plus, its Social Security plus huge debt. That is what it is. You leave future generations with tremendous IOUs. Its time to have a leader that doesnt put off tomorrow what we should do today. Its time to have somebody to step up and say look, lets let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets. The safest of federal investments yields 4%. Thats twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust. Its a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks. Younger worker after younger worker hears my call that says I trust you. And you know what, the issue is changeing. Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and thats exactly what Im going to do. This is a government that thinks a 2% rate of return on your money is satisfactory. Its not. This is a government that says younger workers cant possibly have their own assets. We need to think differently about the issue. We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made. If we dont trust younger workers to manage some of their own money with the Social Security surplus, to grow from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, it will be impossible to bridge the gap without it. What Mr. Gores plan will do causing huge payroll taxes or major benefit reductions. The man loves his wife and I appreciate that a lot. And I love mine. The man loves his family a lot, and I appreciate that, because I love my family. I think the thing that discouraged me about the vice president was uttering those famous words, No controlling legal authority. I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House. I believe that -- I believe theyve moved that sign, The buck stops here from the Oval Office desk to The buck stops here on the Lincoln bedroom. Its not good for the country and its not right. We need to have a new look about how we conduct ourselves in office. Theres a huge trust. I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I dont want you to let me down again. And we can do better than the past administration has done. Its time for a fresh start. Its time for a new look. Its time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism. And so I dont know the man well, but Ive been disappointed about how he and his administration have conducted the fundraising affairs. You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasnt a fundraiser isnt my view of responsibility.MODERATOR: Vice President Gore? They ought to factor in it when they go to the voting booth.MODERATOR: In what way? I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life. I think that -- well, I think thats part of the need for a cultural change. We need to say we each need to be responsible for what we do. People in the highest office of the land must be responsible for decisions they make in life. And thats the way Ive conducted myself as Governor of Texas and thats the way Ill conduct myself as President of the United States, should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote. You know, this man has no credibility on the issue. As a matter of fact, I read in the New York Times where he said he co-sponsored the McCain-Feingold Campaign Fundraising Bill. But he wasnt in the Senate with Senator Feingold. And so, look, Im going to -- what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, Im going to have an attorney general that enforces the law. The time for campaign funding reform is after the election. This man has outspent me and the special interests are outspending me. And I am not going to lay down my arms in the middle of the campaign for somebody who has got no credibility on the issue. I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off. Ive campaigned on this since the primaries. I believe there needs to be instant disclosure on the Internet as to who has given to who. I think we need to fully enforce the law. I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, well enforce it. Be strict and firm about it. I want people to hear what he just said. He is for full public financing of Congressional elections. Im absolutely, adamently opposed to that. I dont want the government financing congressional elections. Thank you, Jim. Thank the University of Massachusetts and Mr. Vice President, thank you. It has been a good, lively exchange. There is a huge difference of opinion. Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives. I also want to go to Washington to get some positive things done. It is going to require a new spirit. A spirit of cooperation. It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, lets come together to do what is right for America. Its been my record as Governor of Texas, it will be how I conduct myself if Im fortunate enough to earn your vote as President of the United States. I want to finally get something done on Medicare. I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors. And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans. I want to finally get something done on Social Security. I want to make sure the seniors have the promise made will be a promise kept, but I want younger workers to be able to manage some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes in the private sector under certain guidelines to get a better rate of return on your own money. I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace. I want to have a strong hand when it comes to the United States in world affairs. I dont want to try to put our troops in all places at all times. I dont want to be the worlds policeman, I want to be the worlds peacemaker by having a military of high morale and a military that is well-equipped. I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends. I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise. Ive had a strong record of working with Democrats and Republicans in Texas to make sure no child is left behind. I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems. My intentions are to earn your vote and earn your confidence. Im asking for your vote. I want you to be on my team. And for those of you working, thanks from the bottom of my heart. For those of you making up your mind, I would be honored to have your support.\"\"\",\"\"\"(Applause) And now the first question as determined by a flip of a coin, it goes to Vice President Gore. Vice President Gore, you have questioned whether Governor Bush has the experience to be President of the United States. What exactly do you mean? Governor Bush, one minute rebuttal. So I take it by your answer, then, Mr. Vice President, in an interview recently with the New York Times when you said that you questioned whether or not Governor Bush has experience enough to be president, you were talking about strictly policy differences. Were going to get a lot of those. Let me just follow up one quick question. When you hear Vice President Gore question your experience, do you read it the same way, that hes talking about policy differences only? Three-and-a-half minutes is up. New question. Governor Bush, you have a question. This is a companion question to the question I asked Vice President Gore. You have questioned whether Vice President Gore has demonstrated the leadership qualities necessary to be President of the United States. What do you mean by that? One quick thing, gentlemen. These are your rules. Im doing my best. Were way over the three minutes. I have no problems with it. Were over the three-and-a-half. Do you want to have a quick response? Were almost to five minutes on this. Let me ask you both this and well move on on the subject. As a practical matter, both of you want to bring prescription drugs to seniors, correct?GORE: Correct.BUSH: Correct. I have an idea. If you have any more to say about this, you can say it in your closing statements and well move on, okay? New question. Vice President Gore. How would you contrast your approach to preventing future oil price and supply problems like we have now to the approach of Governor Bush? So if somebody is watching tonight and listening to what the two of you just said, is it fair to say, okay, the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows. Youre for doing something on the consumption end and youre for doing something on the production end? How would you draw the difference? New question, new subject. Governor Bush. If elected president, would you try to overturn the FDAs approval last week of the abortion pill RU-486? Governor, well go to the Supreme Court question in a moment, but make sure I understand your position on RU-486. If youre elected president, you wont support legislation to overturn this? That means you wouldnt, through appointments, to the FDA and ask them to -- On the Supreme Court question. Should a voter assume -- youre pro-life.BUSH: I am pro-life. Should a voter assume that all judicial appointments you make to the supreme court or any other court, federal court, will also be pro-life? What kind of appointments should they expect from you? Is the vice president right? Reverse the question. What code phrases should we read by what you said about what kind of people you would appoint? Vice President Gore, if President Milosevic of Yugoslavia refuses to leave office, what action, if any, should the United States take to get him out of there? What if he doesnt leave? What if all the diplomatic efforts, all the pressure and he still doesnt go? Is this the kind of thing, and be specific, that you as president would consider the use of U.S. military force to get him gone? New question. How would you go about as president deciding when it was in the national interest to use U.S. force, generally? Vice President Gore, one minute. Vice President Gore, how should the voters go about deciding which one of you is better suited to make the kinds of decisions, whether its Milosevic or whatever, in the military and foreign policy area? Governor, how would you advise the voters to make the decision on this issue? We are way over three-and-a-half minutes. Go ahead. Do you have a problem with that? New subject. New question. Should the voters of this election, Vice President Gore, see this in the domestic area as a major choice between competing political philosophies? I want to see if he buys that. Having cleared that up, were going to a new question. Education. Governor Bush. Both of you have promised dramatically to change -- to change dramatically public education in this country. Of the public money spent on education, only 6% of that is federal money. You want to change 100% of the public education on 6% of the money, is it possible to change it? All right. So having heard the two of you, the voters have just heard the two of you, what is the difference? What is the choice between the two of you on education? New question. Weve been talking about a lot of specific issues. Its often said that in the final analysis about 90% of being the President of the United States is dealing with the unexpected, not with issues that came up in the campaign. Vice President Gore, can you point to a decision, an action you have taken, that illustrates your ability to handle the unexpected, the crisis under fire? New question. There can be all kinds of crises, Governor. A questions for you. There could be a crisis, for instance, in the financial area, the stock market could take a tumble, there could be a failure of a major financial institution. What is your general attitude toward government intervention in such events? So, Governor, would you agree there is no basic difference here on intervening -- on federal government intervening in what might be seen by others to be a private financial crisis? I thought we cleared this up a while ago. New question on Social Security. Both of you have Social Security reform plans, so we could spend the rest of the evening and two or three other evenings talking about them in detail. We wont do that. But --GORE: Suits me. Many experts, including Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, Vice President Gore, say that it will be impossible for either of you, essentially, to keep the system viable on its own during the coming baby boomer retirement onslaught without either reducing benefits or increasing taxes. You disagree? Were almost out of time. New question. Are there issues of character that distinguish you from Vice President Gore? So, Governor, what are you saying when you mention the fundraising scandals or the fundraising charges that involve Vice President Gore? What are you saying that the voters should take from that thats relevant to this election? Are you saying all this is irrelevant, Vice President Gore? Senator McCain -- hold on one second. Senator McCain said in August, It doesnt matter which one of you is President of the United States in January, there is going to be blood on the floor of the United States Senate, and hell tie up the Senate until campaign finance reform is passed that includes a ban on soft money. First of all, would you support that effort by him, or would you sign a bill that is finally passed that included -- On that wonderful note of disagreement, we have to stop here and we want to go now to your closing statements. Governor Bush is first. You have two minutes. Vice President Gore, two minutes. We will continue this dialogue next week on October 11th at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The format then will be more informal, more conversational with the two candidates seated at a table with me. The third will be October 17th at Washington University in St. Louis, and that will follow a town-hall type format. October 5 there is a 90-minute debate between Senator Joe Lieberman and Secretary Dick Cheney. It will be held at Center College in Danville, Kentucky. The moderator will be Bernard Shaw of CNN. Thank you, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. See you next week. For now from Boston, Im Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.(APPLAUSE)\"\"\"\n",
      "October 16 1996,The President,Senator Dole,\"\"\"I was going to applaud, too. [Laughter] Well, thank you, Jim, and thanks to the people of San Diego for giving us this opportunity to have another discussion about the decision we all face in front of people who will make the decision. Again I will say, Ill do my best to make this a discussion of ideas and issues, not insults. What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility. I have a simple philosophy that Ive tried to follow for the last 4 years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybodys got a role to play and a place at the table. Compared to 4 years ago, were clearly better off. Weve got 10 1/2 million more jobs; the deficits been reduced by 60 percent; incomes are rising for the first time in a decade; the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling; were putting 100,000 more police on the street; 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers have been denied handguns. But that progress is only the beginning. What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future thats out there. I think what really matters is what we can do to help build strong families. Strong families need a strong economy. To me, that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment. We should give a tax cut targeted to childrearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care. We ought to help protect our kids from drugs and guns and gangs and tobacco. We ought to help move a million people from welfare to work. And we ought to create the finest education system in the world, where every 18-year-old can go on to college and all of our younger children have great educational opportunities. If we do those things, we can build that bridge to the 21st century. Thats what I hope to get to talk about tonight. Thank you. One of the reasons that I ran for President, Sandy, is because not just children, a lot of grownups felt that way. If you remember, 4 years ago we had not only rising unemployment but a lot of rising cynicism. Id never worked in Washington as an elected official. It seemed to me that most of the arguments were partisan: Republican, Democrat; left, right; liberal, conservative. Thats why I said tonight Im for opportunity, responsibility, and community. And weve gotten some real progress in the last 4 years. Ive also done everything I could at every moment of division in this countryafter Oklahoma City, when these churches were burnedto bring people together and remind people that we are stronger because of our diversity. We have to respect one another. You mentioned Washington and Lincoln; they were Presidents at historic times. This is an historic time. Its important that we go beyond those old partisan arguments and focus on people and their future. When we do that, instead of shutting the Government down over a partisan fight on the budget, were a better country, and thats why were making progress now. I will. First of all, let me say what we have done: In the last 4 years, weve worked hard to promote more competition to bring down the rate of inflation in health care costs without eroding health care quality. The Government pays for Medicare and Medicaid, as you know, and thats very important. Secondly, weve added a million more children to the ranks of the insured through the Medicaid program. We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you cant lose your health insurance if you change jobs or if someone in your familys been sick. We just recently ended those drive-by deliveries, saying people couldnt be kicked out of the hospital by insurance companies when theyd just had babies. So this isthats a good start. In the next 4 years, I want to focus on the following things: Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program; number two, keep working with the States, as we are now, to add 2.2 million more people to the insurance system; number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to 6 monthsthat could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids; and number four, make sure we protect the integrity of the Medicare program and the Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close, as could have been the case if the $270 billion Medicare cut that I vetoed had been enacted into law. I dont have time in 30 seconds to respond to fix all that. But let me just say, the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals, not me. And on a per-person basis, it did cut way below the rate of inflation in medical costs. But the important thing is, what are we going to do now? We need to help people who are between jobs. We need to cover more kids. We need to provide more preventive care. My balanced budget covers mammograms for ladies onwomen on Medicare and also gives respite care to the million-plus families who have someone with Alzheimers. These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan. It will move us forward. May I ask you a question? What kind ofwhich service are you in? And what kind of small business do you have? Good for you. Well, let me saySenator Dole mentioned this. I just signed a bill that we got through Congress to increase the amount of pay increase we could give for military personnel and to make sure the pay increase this year was above the rate of inflation. I also had presented to the Congress, and they adopted, a large package of quality-of-life improvements which are very important. Ive spent a lot of time talking to military families, as well as military members, all over the world and in bases all across the United States. And I became convinced, after talking to the families and the personnel in uniform, that we needed to not only have the pay raise but we needed to invest more in child care, housing, and other things to support families, especially when there are longer deployments because of the downsizing of the military. So were going to do better, and well do better still. But this is a commitment I think that all Americans share, without regard to party. Let me just take 2 seconds of my time, because Im the Commander in Chief, to respond to one thing that was said. I propose to spend $1.6 trillion on defense between now and the year 2002. And theres less than one percent difference between my budget and the Republican budget on defense. Now, on the Middle East, as you know, Ive worked very hard for peace in the Middle East. The agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis was signed at the White House. And the agreement, the peace treaty with Jordan, I went to Jordan to sign that, to be there. But and I think the United States could do whatever we reasonably can. I can say this: I do not believe Yasser Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank. We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank. I saw the agreement that Prime Minister Rabin and Yasser Arafat signed on the West Bank. It had 26 separate maps they had to sign, literally thousands of delineations of who would do what on the West Bank. And I believe if the parties will get together and in a good faith manner make that agreement, that theyll be able to do it. We cannot impose a peace on the Middle East. My position has always been that the job of the United States was to minimize the risks of peace. You know, if they ask me to be part of some monitoring forceas we are in the Sinai and have been since 1978 to monitor the peace between Egypt and Israelfrankly, I would have to think about it; I would have to see what they wanted to do. But I dont believe that will be the request. I think what Mr. Arafat wants us to do is to make sure that everybody honors the agreements theyve already made. Thats why I brought the leaders to Washington a few days ago. I think they will, and I think well get there. Dont be too discouraged. When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying, We dont want to abandon the peace process. We want more security. Then, a lot of mutual distrust developed. A lot of things happened which maybe shouldnt have happened. When I asked Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to Washington and got them together and they talked alone for 3 hours, I was convinced that they had to have a chance to make that peace. Again, Id say if they ask us to play some reasonable role, I dont know how I would respond. It would depend entirely on what they ask us to do. But the real secret there is for them to abide by the agreements theyve made and find a way to trust each other. And theyre going to have to spend some time and trust each other. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life believing that that trust could be materialized, and I still think it can be. Oscar, the question of what the Federal Government should do to limit the access of tobacco to young people is one of the biggest differences between Senator Dole and me. We did propose a regulation 6 months after I became President under the law he mentioned. It simply says all these Statesit made it illegal for kids to smokenow they have to try harder if they want to keep getting Federal funds. Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments about how we ought to do it. Thats what drug it out. Meanwhile, we started, also in 93, to look into whether cigarettes were addictive enough for the Federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the ability of cigarette companies to advertise, market, and distribute tobacco products to our kids. No President had ever taken on the tobacco lobby before. I did. Senator Dole opposed me. He went down and made a speech to people who were on his side, saying that I did the wrong thing. I think I did the right thing. On drugs, I have repeatedly said drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you. We have strengthened enforcement, and everybody in San Diego knows weve strengthened control of the border. Weve done a lot more; I hope we get a chance to talk about it. First of all, theyre two different things. Social Security and Medicare are entirely different in terms of the financial stabilities. Lets talk about them separately. Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century. But wed like to have a Social Security fund that has about 70 years of life instead of about 30 years of life. What we have to do is simply to make some adjustments that take account of the fact that the baby boomers, people like me, are bigger in number than the people that went just before us and the people that come just after us. And I think what well plainly do is what we did in 1983, when Senator Dole servedand this is something I think he did a good job on when he served on the Social Security Commission and they made some modest changes in Social Security to make sure that it would be alive and well into the 21st century. And we will do that. Its obvious that there are certain things that have to be done, and there are 50 to 60 different options. And a bipartisan commission, to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people. Medicare is different. Medicare needs help now. I have proposed a budget which would put 10 years on the life of the Medicare Trust Fund; thats more than its had a lot of the time for the last 20 years. It would save a lot of money through more managed care but giving more options, more preventive care, and lowering the inflation rate in the prices were paying providers without having the kind of big premium increases and outof-pocket costs that the budget I vetoed would provide. Then that will give us 10 years to do with Medicare what were going to do with Social Security: have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire. But now we ought to pass this budget now and put 10 years on it right away so no one has to worry about it. Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more a year this year. Their idea was to budget that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals. Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoednot in an election year, sir, I told them in early 95. Senator Dole said 30 years ago he was one of 12 people that voted against Medicare and he was proud of it. A year ago he said, I was right then; I knew it wouldnt work. American seniors have the highest life expectancy in the world. We need to reform it, not wreck it. Its illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits. Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me. I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly physically isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble. So Id been working on it when I was a Governor for a long time. When I became President, I used the authority I had in this law to get out from under certain Federal rules to help States move people to work. Weve reduced the welfare rolls by 2 million already. Now Ive got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector to give employers specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, to move more people from welfare to work. Its very important. And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more. There is not a more important issue. I still remember a woman that I met 10 years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tellgive an answer when they say, What does your mother do for a job? I met that woman again. Shes got four kids. Ones got a good job; ones studying to be a doctor; ones in technical school; ones an honor student in high school. I want to make more people like that woman, Lillie Harden. So Ive got a plan to do it. And its just beginning. First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes. Part of my tax package, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains for people when they sell their home, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans. We also have a capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for 5 years. It was part of our other economic plan. And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system. I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a stronger economy. And we cant have any tax cut thats not paid for. One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how Im going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend. Weve worked hard to bring this deficit down, and thats helped people in the real estate business, because the interest rates are lower. Weve got homeownership at a 15year high. Weve got this country going in the right direction. So we can have a tax cut, but my priority would be to help the families who need it with childrearing and education and buying a firsttime home and helping for health care costs. So from your business, helping in buying the first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about. Thank you, Pamela. Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them. And we all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent, but we have to prove we can pay for them. After he left the Senate, we abandoned that. Thats why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates, and weaken the economy. And that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy. Thats why we have to balance the budget. And Ill tell you how Im going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line. You should expect that from both of us. I can only tell you that I dont think Senator Dole is too old to be President. Its the age of his ideas that I question. Youre almost not old enough to remember this, but weve tried this before, promising people an election-year tax cut thats not paid for telling you you can have everything you gotand let me just say this: Did you hear him say the Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships? They did, after he left. The last budget he led cut Pell grants, cut student loans. I vetoed it when they shut the Government down. My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of the typical community college tuition, a $10,000 deduction a year for the cost of college tuition, would let families save in an IRA and withdraw tax-free to pay for the cost of education. And its all paid for. My whole administration is about your future, its about what the 21st century is going to be like for you. And I hope youll look at the ideas in it. Thank you. No, maam, I dont. I am against quotas; Im against giving anybody any kind of preference for something theyre not qualified for, but because I still believe that there is some discrimination and that not everybody has an opportunity to prove they are qualified, I favor the right kind of affirmative action. Ive done more to eliminate programsaffirmative action programs that I didnt think were fair and to tighten others up than my predecessors have since affirmative action has been around, but I have also worked hard to give people a chance to prove that they are qualified. Let me just give you some examples. Weve doubled the number of loans from the Small Business Administration, tripled the number of loans to women business peopleno one unqualified. Everybody had to meet the standards. Weve opened 260,000 new jobs in the military to women since Ive been President, but the Joint Chiefs say were stronger and more competent and solid than ever. Let me give you another example of what I mean. To me, affirmative action is making that extra effort. Its sort of like what Senator Dole did when he sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act that said to certain stores, Okay, youve got to make it accessible to people with wheelchairs. We werent guaranteeing anythinganybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it. And thats why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that were not there yet. We ought to keep making those extra-effort affirmative action programs the law and the policy of the land. I have never supported quotas. Ive always been against them. They dont favor equal results. But I do favor making sure everybody has a chance to prove theyre competent. The reason I have opposed that initiative is because Im afraid it will end those extra-effort programs. Again I say think of the American with Disabilities Act. Make an effort to put a ramp up there so someone in a wheelchair can get up. You dont guarantee that they get the job; you guarantee they have a chance to prove theyre competent. And as Ive said, this is not a partisan thing with me. General Powell, Colin Powell said the same thing. He fears that the initiative would take away the extra-effort programs. No preferences to unqualified people, no quotas, but dont give up on making an extra effort till youre sure everybody has a chance to prove theyre qualified. So am I. I am too. You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because its truth. When they had a $250 billion tax schemethat is half the size of this one, this one is 550they passed a budget that had $270 billion in Medicare cuts, the first education cuts in history, cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent, took away the guarantee of quality standards in nursing homes, took away the guarantee of health care to folks with disabilities. Dont take my word for this. The Economist magazine polled lots of economists. Seven Nobel Prize winners have said, if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts40 percent in the environment, in law enforcement, in education. It will require bigger cuts in Medicare than I vetoed last time. My targeted tax cut gives tax cuts for education, childrearing, buying a first-time home, paying for health care costs, and its paid for. And Ive told you how Ill pay for it. He wont tell you because he cant. Thank you. Well, first let me say that I signed the family leave act. It was my very first bill, and Im very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing. I dont take credit for all the good things that have happened in America, but I take credit for what Ive tried to do to work with others to make good things happen. The most important good things that happen in America happen in families. Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children? Family and medical leave has let 12 million families take a little time off for the birth of a child or a family illness without losing their job. Id like to see it expanded in two ways: Id like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctors appointment with a family member; Id also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flextime so that at the discretion of the worker the workerif you earn overtime you could decide whether you want that time to be taken in cash or in time with your family if youve got a family problem. I never go anywhere, it seems like, where I dont meet somebody whos benefited from the family leave law. In Longview, Texas, the other day, I met a woman who was almost in tears because she had been able to keep her job while spending time with her husband who had cancer. One of the people whos here with me today met a woman in the airport saying that her son just was able to be present at the birth of his child because of the family leave law. So yes, I think it should be expanded. We have to help people succeed at home and at work. I only have 30 seconds. I cant fix the statistics. It covers the majority of the work force. Employers of under 50 are exempted. The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50. Senator Dole led the opposition to it. He filibustered it. He said it was a mistake. He said it would hurt the economy. Weve had record numbers of new small businesses and 10 1/2 million jobs. It didnt hurt the economy. He still believes its a mistake. I believe it was right. You can decide which of us you think are right. Its up to you. Lets look at the facts. We lost a lot of manufacturing jobs in the 12 years before I became President. Weve gained manufacturing jobs since Ive been President. Weve negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements. Lets just take California. In California, we made $37 billion worth of telecommunications equipment eligible for exports for the first time. Were selling everything from telephones to CDs to rice in Japan. Were selling American automobiles in Japan now. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Japan. Were number one in automobile manufacturing, production, and sales around the world again for the first time since the 1970s. Why? Because weve had tough, aggressive trade policies, and because we got interest rates down, and we had a good, stable economic policy, because weve reduced the deficit 4 years in a row for the first time in the 20th century that a Presidents done that in all 4 years. And thats why I dont want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we cant pay for so your interest rates will go up and youll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut. So I say keep working on expanding the markets. More than half of these 10 1/2 million new jobs were in higher wage areas, and well have more manufacturing and more sales at home and around the world. Im for it. Thats my policy. Im for it. I believe that any law-abiding taxpaying citizen who shows up in the morning and doesnt break the law and doesnt interfere with his or her neighbors ought to have the ability to work in our country and shouldnt be subject to unfair discrimination. Im for it. Now, I have a little time left, so let me just say that I get attacked so many times on these questions its hard to answer all those things. In FebruarySenator Dole just said we had the worst economy in a century. In February he said we had the best economy in 30 years just February. And I dont want to respond in kind to all these things. I could; I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat. But I hope we can talk about what were going to do in the future. No attack ever created a job or educated a child or helped a family make ends meet. No insult ever cleaned up a toxic waste dump or helped an elderly person. Now, for 4 years thats what Ive worked on. If youll give me 4 years more, Ill work on it some more. And Ill try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future, and I gave you a direct answer. If you believe that the California economy was better in 1992 than it is today, you should vote for Bob Dole. I have worked so hard out here to help turn this economy around. Let me just give you one tiny example. In San Diego, where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project with the University of California, San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges a little project, and a program that Senator Dole opposedand that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs. Thats just one tiny example. Maybe well talk about some more before its over. Im just curious. How many of you are under managed care plans? Raise your hand if youre in managed care. How many of you like it? Well One of the things that I tried to do was to make sure that everybody in the country who was under a managed care plan should at least have three choices of plans and would have the right to get out without penalty every year. Now, thats not a Government takeover, thats like the family and medical leave law. It just tries to set the rules of the game. Im strongly in favor of a Federal bill to repeal theany gag rules on providers. In other words, I believe that doctors should not be able to be kicked out of managed care plans just because they tell the patients what they need and what more expensive care options might be. If were saving money and managing resources better, thats a good thing. If were saving money and depriving people of care, thats a bad thing. A good place to start is to say no managed care provider can gag a doctor and kick the doctor out of the managed care plan for the doctor telling the patient, You need a more expensive test, you need a more expensive procedure. Your health requires it. First of all, I think its important to make voting more accessible. Thats why I strongly supported the motor voter law. There was a big story, I think, in USA Today about the millions of people whove now registered because of it. Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible. You know, several States now are letting people vote over 3 weeks. A lot of people are busy, and its hard for them to just get there and vote. The third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform, because if you want to cut the cost of campaigns, you have to open the airwaves, because what drives the cost of a campaign are the costs of advertising on television, radio, newspaper, mass mailing. And if you open the airwaves to more things like thisyou see, its not just you that are participating here. For every one of you who stood up here and asked a question tonight, I promise you, theres 100,000 Americans that said, I wish I could have asked that question. So I think we have to change the nature of politics. The last thing I think we should do is something Ive been trying to do since Ive been President, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country in Washington with more police on the street in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here. Those are my best ideas about it. Let me make one other suggestion. As youre a teacher, you can have an impact on that. One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often, political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people. Now, there is a connection, and I think what we have to do is convince people theres a big difference. If you vote one way, you will have a Department of Education in the 21st century; if you vote the other way, you wont. If you vote one way, youll have an expansion of family leave; if you vote the other way, youll be lucky to save it. But these are important questions, and people have to decide. I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether theres a connection in their lives and what we do in Washington. This is one where we have some agreement, I think. Only about half the people in this country have pension plans, and Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least its not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle. So weve got to figure out how were going to have more people with pension plans. And pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses. So what is in my planand I think its almost identical to whats in Senator Doles planis we make more people than are now eligible to save in an IRA, and wed let couplesmarried couples save more, and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to for medical emergencies or to buy a home or for an education, but they could also save to supplement their retirement. In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small-business people to take out 401(k) plans for themselves and their employees and then much easier for employees to carry it from job to job. My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman, and he told me last time he changed employers it took him 9 months to figure out how to transfer his 401(k) plan. Now, none of that will happen anymore. And so I hope that over the next 10 years youll see a big increase in the percentage of people that have pension plans plus a secure Social Security System. Let me tell you what we have done. We have concluded with Japan 21, about to be 22 trade agreements now. And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded trade agreements, our exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last 4 years, and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down. Until about 5 months ago, the Japanese economy was in a deep recession. Its coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think itll go down more. But Im verythats one of the real success stories here of the work weve done. Were selling Japanese rice from California for the first time. I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo. I visited a Jeep plant, the oldest auto plant in America, in Toledo, Ohio, where theyre going to export 41,000 right-hand-drive Jeeps this year, and theyve got 700 new jobs because of it. There is no easy way to do this. When youre dealing with an economy thats traditionally been more closed and one thats traditionally been more open, you just have to gut it out issue by issue by issue. We agreed in principle on our insurance agreement, and were working on three or four other areas now. But the way you have to do it is make sure youre competitivewere the most competitive country in the world nowand then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale. And thats what our trade ambassador, our Commerce Secretary, and all the other people in our administration have tried to do. Let me say again, weve had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last 4 years, by far the largest number in American history, not just the big ones youve read about but a lot of smaller ones. And now what we have to do is to focus on those things were real good at and make sure were getting a fair deal. We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs and costing thousands of jobs in places like California. But we said, You know, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, youre going to have to quit pirating our CDs. And they agreed to do a number of things and to let us verify that theyd done it. But I think theyre going to make the problem much better. But there is not a simple, easy answer. You just have to work on this day-in and day-out, every month, every year, every issue to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade. Im proud that were better off on that than we were 4 years ago. This is the most religious great country in history, and yet, interestingly enough, we have the most religious freedom of any country in the world, including the freedom not to believe. And now we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County weve got people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups, and theyve got tons of different religions. But the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same. And what Ive tried to do is to support policies that would respect religion, and then help parents inculcate those values to their children. Let me very briefly give you some examples. One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says the Governments got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice. So I changed a Justice Department effort to get a church to pay back a mans tithe because he was bankrupt when he gave it. Ive supported character education programs in our schools, drug-free schools programs. Ive supported giving parents a V-chip on their television so if they dont want their young kids to watch things they shouldnt watch, they wouldnt have to. Thats the kind of thing we need to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children. I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing. We dont need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray. And what I did was to have the Justice Department and the Education Department, for the first time ever, issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy, when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the Constitution just because they were on a public school grounds. And I think anyone who has experienced this would tell you that our administration has done more than any in 30 years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools. Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself. It wouldnt be fair for me to do that. I would wind upI mean, its the last question, and Id mischaracterize it to try to make you happy. Let me tell you what I feel. We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other peoples decisions are wrong, even immoral. But under our Constitution, if you show up tomorrow and obey the law, and you work hard, and you do what you are supposed to do, youre entitled to equal treatment. Thats the way the system works. All over the world, people are being torn apartBosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi, you name itbecause of all their differences. We still have some of that hatred inside us; you see it in the church burnings. And one of the things Ive tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that were stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences. Let me say again, there is no more important responsibility for the President than to say, If you believe in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence, thats all we need to know. And you can be part of our America, and you can walk across that bridge to the 21st century with us. And we are not well served when we attack each other in a kind of an ad hominem way. It doesnt create jobs. It doesnt educate children. It doesnt solve problems. We need to be disagreeing on ideas honestly and talking about the future. The future will be the greatest time in this countrys history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world. Thank you, Jim. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching. One thing Id like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said. Its a remarkable thing in a country like ours that a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for President, could have a chance to serve as President. So the first thing I want to say is thank you for giving me the chance to be President. This election is about two different visions about how we should go into the 21st century. Would we be better offas I believeworking together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, Youre on your own? Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it, or saying, You can get across yourself? If you dont leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us dont leave with anything else, I hope youll leave with this: This is a real important election. The world is changing dramatically in how we work and how we live, how we relate to each other huge changes. And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences. So weve talked about our responsibilities tonight. I want to talk about your responsibility and your responsibility. Your responsibility is to show up on November 5th, because youre going to decide whether were going to balance the budget now but protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. Youll decide whether were going to keep fighting crime with the Brady bill, the assault weapons, and finish putting those 100,000 police; whether were going to move a million people from welfare to work; whether were going to give our families more protection for their kids against drugs and tobacco and gangs and guns; whether were going to give our children world-class education where every 8-year-old can read, every 12-yearold can log in on the Internet, every 18-yearold can go to college. If we do those things, well build that bridge to the 21st century, and the greatest country in history will be even greater. Thank you. \"\"\",\"\"\"Thank you very much, Jim. Let me first give you a sports update: the Braves, one; Cardinals, nothingearly on. I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight, and I want a special thanks to my wife, Elizabeth, and my daughter, Robin, for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America. In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century. Its an awesome responsibility. And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates? You should know as much as possible about each of us. Sometimes the views have been distortedand millions and millions of dollars in negative advertising spent distorting my views but I hope tonight youll get a better feel of who Bob Dole is and what hes all about. But in any event, I understand the problems, whether its two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family; whether its a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills; or whether youre worried about an education for your childrenare they going to the best schools; or whether youre worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools. Hi. These are the ideals and morals that we are trying to teach our children in these days, yet we dont seem to be practicing them in our Government, in anything. If you are President, how will you begin to practice what we are preaching to our children, the future of our Nation? Well, I would say, first of all, I think its a very good question, and I appreciate the quote from the young man. Theres no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government. They see scandals almost on a daily basis. They see ethical problems in the White House today. They see 900 FBI files of private persons being gathered up by somebody in the White House; nobody knows who hired this man. So theres a great deal of cynicism out there. But Ive always tried, in whatever Ive done, to bring people together. I said in my acceptance speech in San Diego about 2 months ago that the exits are clearly marked. If you think the Republican Party is someplace for you to come if youre narrow-minded or bigoted or dont like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of, as I stand here without compromise because this is the party of Lincoln. I think we have a real obligation, obviously, public officials. Im no longer a public official; I left public life on June 11th of this year. But it is very important. Young people are looking to us. Theyre looking to us for leadership. Theyre watching what we do, what we say, what we promise, and what we finally deliver. And I would thinkit seems to me that there are opportunities here. When Im President of the United States, I will keep my word. My word is my bond. Well, bringing people together again is obviously a responsibility we all have. I know you do it. Everybody here does it. You do a lot of things nobody knows about. I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation. Weve raised about $10 million. We dont talk about it. We try to help people with disabilities. We bring them back into the mainstream of public life. So it seems to me that theres also a public trust. When youre the President of the United States, you have a public trust, and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington did and as Abraham Lincoln did. And I think now that trust is being violated. And it seems to me we ought to face up to it, and the President ought to say tonight that hes not going to pardon anybody that he was involved in business with who might implicate him later on. First, let me say there you go again, Mr. President, talking about a Medicare cut. Now, Ive heard you say this time after time, and Ive heard you say on one TV appearance, The media made me do it. You were trying to defend your cut, which was not a cut eithera reduction in the growth of spending. And we always had at least 7 percent. Youve said publicly that its now 3 times the rate of inflation, we ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation. Thats about where we are now. So lets stop talking about cutting Medicare. In my economic plan we increase it 39 percent. Dont forget what he tried to do with health care: 17 new taxes, spend $1.5 trillion, 50 new bureaucracies. Can you believe that? You couldnt even have been a cardiologist because they had quotas. You hadyou couldntyoure a cardiologist; it wouldnt affect you. But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist 10 years from now, youd have to be certain that you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the Government was going to take over for all Americans. There are things we can do like the Kassebaum bill, that retains many provisions I authored, to cover preexistingexistingportability. And there are other things we can do. We still need to cover about 20 million people and a lot of children. Jason, I appreciate that very much, being a former military man myself. You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps. It shouldnt happen in America. We have men and women wearing our uniform in substandard housing. It shouldnt happen in America. And its time we take a look at the pay scales. You did get a 3 percent increase this year, but thats not enough. If were going to ask young men and young women to protect us and defend us around the world, and weve had more deployments under this administration than any time in history 50 times we deployed troops around the world. Every time you do that, you take a risksomebody you know, maybe your son, maybe your grandson, maybe somebody else. But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American. Remember Vietnam, remember when people almost used to walk across the street rather than have contact with somebody who was in Vietnamthats all behind us now, and it should be behind usand the forgotten war, the Korean war. But I guess, I can just answer you very plainly, Jason: Thank you for doing what youre doing. America owes you a debt of gratitude. Well, Jason, I dont disagree with anything the President said except he waited 4 years to do these things. And my view is it ought to beitll be done on day one. Well start working on it on day one in the Dole-Kemp administration. This is important. Now, we only have 10 divisions now; we used to have 18. We had 25 fighter wings; were down to 13. We had 536 ships; were down to 336 ships. I mean, weve cut defense spending too much in the first place. The President told you in 92 he would cut it $67 billion; he cut $112 billion. So were right on the edge right now. But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniform sacrifice. Well, let me, Jason, come back to you a minute because there is a big difference in the defense budget. We had $7 billion this year, and $10 billion more than the President. He puts his money in the out years even if he were reelected, you know, hed be gone before anything happened. And nothings going to happen, because we dont have modernization now. If we dont build more B-2 bombers in Californiaand we lost about 500,000 jobs out in California because of this devastation, these big, big cuts. We had to make cuts; we didnt have to make the cuts the President promised hed make and then he doubled. And so I think we need to go back and take a look. Were increasing defense reasonably, not too much but we are increasing defense some, because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason. I would say I didnt hear what Yasser Arafat had to say, but I dont want toyou know, I think foreign policy is something we want to be very careful about. And Im not here to argue about the President on some ongoing foreign policy matter. What I want the President to do, and I think he may have done it in his last statement, is call for an unconditional end to the violence and have the parties keep on talking as they should talk and have a resolution. The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere. But lets sort of keep this out of politics, because its pretty dicey right now. . Oscar. Oh, thatthats very easy. My record going back to 1965 in the Congress, the first vote we had was whether or not you should put a little notice on cigarettes that they may be dangerousI votedI voted for everything since that time. In fact, in 1992 we had a bill come before us that all the States had to comply or theyre going to lose certain money. We sent it to the Clinton administration for implementation. They waited 3 1/2 years. And during that period about 3,000 young kids every day started smoking. If you add it up, thats about 3 millionnot until again 1996. I dont want anybody to smoke. My brother probably died partly because of cigarettes. I was asked a technical question: Are they addictive? Maybe theythey probably are addictive. I dont know; Im not a doctor. You shouldnt smoke. You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar 30 years? And it seems to me that what we need to do is to talk about not only tobacco but drugs, because drug use in 12- and 17year-olds has doubled in this administration, the last 44 months. Marijuana use is up 141 percent; cocaine use, up 160 percent. Theyre your kids. Its all happened in this administration because they cut funding and they cut interdiction. When Im President of the United States, were going to use the National Guard and whatever resources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America. If you stop the drugs, nobody is going to use the drugs. So dont smoke, dont drink, dont use drugs. Just dont do it. Well, they also know, if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if youre caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico; youre not prosecuted. You have a U.S. Attorney here that sends them back home. So I think thats pretty important. Thats a lot of marijuana. Thats a big supply. But dontyou know, dont get into this smokescreen here, Oscar. The President, in the election year, decided, Well, I ought to do something. I havent done anything on drugs. Ive been AWOL for 44 months. So lets take on smoking. But see, they havent even done it. They havent said whats going to happen, whether theyre going to have it declared addictive; its going to apply just toonce its a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or to everybody in America? Nobody should smoke, young or old. But particularly, young people should not smoke. And my record is there. Its been there. Ive voted 8, 10 times since 1965. Well, again, you know, if youre somebody thinking about the future, I think its fair to say that itll bewell work it out. I mean, this is a political year, and the Presidents playing politics with Medicare. But after this years over well resolve it just as we did with Social Security in 1983. It was a nonpartisan commission. Ronald Reagan got together with Tip ONeill and Howard Bakertwo Republicans and one Democratand they formed a commission. I was on that commission. We resolvedwe rescued Social Security. We suggestedI think its been over a year ago now we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick. Now last week, I guess it was, Donna Shalala said, Well, well cut Medicare a hundred billion, and well appoint a commission. It will probably have to be done by a commission. Take it out of politics. I think if I were a senior citizen Id be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans, and scaring students about education. But when you dont have any ideas, when you dont have any agenda, and all you have is fear, thats all you can use. We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign, and well rescue Medicare as we did Social Security. Well, weve taken the first step. We took it three steps. Twice we sent welfare reform to the President, and he vetoed it. On the third time we sent welfare reform to the President, he signed it but announced he would change it next year. And the Vice President said they were going to do something else through the line item veto, which Ive never understood, but thats sort of inside baseball. What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work. And Im standing here as someone who a long time agoas the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was to go through all the welfare checks and sign them. And three of those checks were my grandparents. So I know what its like to have to look welfare head-on. Obviously some people are going to need help. This is the United States of America. Youre not going to go without food, and youre not going to go without medical care. This is America. But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, were going to provide jobs. Were going to say you have a 5-year limit that you can be on welfare. Youve got 2 years to look for a job. We provided more money for day care in the bill that passed the Senate and was vetoed. Then it came back, and the President signed pretty much the same bill. But this is an important issue. I dont think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants. I mean, it puts a heavy burden on a State likeexcept for emergencies. It puts a heavy burden on States like California. It costs California taxpayers $3 billion a year. Ill get out of your way here. Well, another thing we can dowe talk about growthweve got a great economic package which I hope well discuss later: across the board tax cut; child credits, $500 per child under 18; reduce the capital gains rate; create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare. And we have other provisions: less litigation. The trial lawyersbig supporters of the Presidentthe trial lawyers, of course they like lawsuits, so every time they have a bill that they want vetoed, the President vetoes it for them. Weve got to understand in America that weve got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector. The President takes credit for all of these people off welfarethe Governors did that. Federal Government doesnt do that. And the Government doesnt create jobs, theyre created in the private sector. Well, Pamela, what the President didnt tell you is that all his tax cuts expire at the year 2000, but all his increases go on forever. Thats the liberal approach. You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever. So the net tax increase in his plan is somewhere between $60 billion and $80 billion. We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless your home is worth over $500,000and if it is, I appreciate it, congratulate youbut in any event, no tax. And its a good idea. They saw it, and they picked it up and put in theirs, but its only temporary. Ours is permanent. Ours is a good plan: create jobs and opportunities; capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it from 28 percent to 14 percent. There are $7 trillion in assets locked up in America. If we cut the capital gains rateIm told every day I got a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying, I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas. I cant because the capital gains rate is too high. We need to get the economy going. That will help Social Security. That will create more jobs. That will help people who want to get off welfare. Its the American way. Well, I think age is veryyou know, wisdom comes from age, experience, and intelligence. And if you have some of each and I have some age, some experience, some intelligence[laughter]that adds up to wisdom. I think it also is a strength; its an advantage. And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign. This is about America. This is aboutsomebody said earlier, one of the first questions, were together. Its one America, one nation. Im looking at our economic plan because Im concerned about the future for young people. Im looking about drugs. The Presidents been AWOL for 4 years. Im looking about crime. Hell claim credit now for crime going down, but it happened because mayors and Governors and others have brought crime down. Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City, but of course the President will take credit for that. My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education. This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans, went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next 6 years a 50 percent increase; the highest appropriation ever, $6 billion for Pell grants. Very, very important. And we also raised the amount of each Pell grant. In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people. Rolled over and over and overof course, not this age, but if you have a child 2 years old, 7 percent interest, it would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college. We tried it last time you ran. Well, when you dont have any ideas, I guess you say the other persons ideas are old. As I said earlier, they dont have any ideas. Their idea is to raise taxes and spend more money. Thats the liberal philosophy. If thats what you like, youve got a perfect candidate. President Clinton came to California in 1992 and said, The centerpiece in my first 4 years is going to be a middle class tax cut. Now, to all you who got that tax cut, congratulations, because you got a big tax increase. You got a $265 billion tax increase. And he stands here and says politicians who make promises like that ought to be ignored. Well, he made the promise. I keep my word, and youll have a tax cut. It will help you in whatever youre going to do in the next few years. Thank you. Well, we may not be there yet, but were not going to get there by giving preferences and quotas. I supported that route for some time, and again, I think it gets back to experiencea little experience, a little age, a little intelligence. And I noticed that nobody was really benefiting except a very small group at the top. The average person wasnt benefiting. People who had the money were benefiting. People who got all the jobs were benefiting. This is America. No discrimination. Discrimination ought to be punished, but there ought to be equal opportunity. We ought to reach out and make certain everybody has a chance to participate. Equal opportunity, but we cannot guarantee equal results in America. Thats not how America became the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Oh, Im glad you asked. Whats your first name? Tim? I first want to say the President didnt quite give you all the stuff on quotas, because the Justice Department entered what we call the Piscataway case up in New Jersey. Its pretty clear that was a quota case. And just because one teacher was white and one teacher was black and they had the same qualification, you know, they decided who would stay there. It shouldnt be that way. Now, the President can say, well, he wants to mend it, not end it. There are 168 Federal programs that allow quotas. He ended one. Now this economic package, Tim, Im glad you asked because you look like the type that might be able to benefit from the 15 percent, across-the-board tax cut and $500-per-child tax credit or, you know, estate tax relief, which youre not interested in right now, but capital gains rate reductionif youre taking care of an elderly parent, you get a $1,000 deduction. We think thats very important because a lot of people take care of their parents. How do we pay for it? Were going to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, which the President opposed and defeated. He twisted arms, got six Democrats to vote with him. We lost by one vote. Were going to balance the budget by the year 2002. The President wants to spend 20 percent more over the next 6 years; I want to spend 14 percent more and give that 6 percent back to the people. Remember, its your money. Its not his money, and its not my money. Its your money, and you shouldnt have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it, but he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more. He wants to give you sort of a Government tax cut which really doesnt mean anything. Your targeted tax cut, Mr. President, never hits anybody. Thats the problem with it. Nobody ever gets it. But I must say Im a little offended by this word scheme. You talked aboutlast time you talked about a risky scheme, and then Vice President Gore repeated it about 10 times in St. Petersburg. If I have anything in politics, its my word. My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will tell you that Bob Dole kept his word. Im going to keep my word to you. Im going to keep my word to the American people. Were going to cut taxes and balance the budget. Were not going to touch Medicare. Its going to grow 39 percent, and Social Security is going to grow 34 percent. Now, the President doesnt have any ideas so hes out trashing ours. This isnt going to blow a hole in the deficit. He promised you a tax cut in 1992, and if you got one, you ought to vote for him. Well, 88 percent of the people the President claims, or 11 million, are already covered. And only 5 percentkeep in mind, only 5 percent of the employers were even affected by the family leave act. We had a better idea. We didnt win, but we had a better idea. Now we have a majority; we need to get a President. That was a tax credit to the employer. Instead of the Federal Government reaching out, we had a tax credit to pick up some of the cost, because if you have to hire a replacement worker, thats a cost. This is the way it ought to work. Give more power back to the States and back to the people, back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the Federal Government. But keep in mind this bill covers 5 percent of the employers; 95 percent of the employers and all those employees they employ are not covered in this act. And according to Investors Daily, which I read just a couple of days ago, 88 percent of the people he claims credit for were already covered in collective bargaining agreements or other agreements. We had family leave in our office. Im certainI see my friend Senator Mitchell. He had family leave. I work every day with people. I spent a lot of time in hospitals. I know what its like to be in a hospital. Sure, we want family leave, but theres a better way to do it. Well, right, weve lost 357,000 manufacturing jobs. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics said today that they made a mistake, its probably going to be a much, much higher figure. So were talking about all these new jobs, wed better wait and see what the results are. Were going to do that with a more aggressive trade policy. Were going to do that with an economic package. Were going to do that with regulatory reform. You know, regulations cost the average familyright here, Democrat or Republicanabout $7,000 a year7,000. Its like a tax. Put a lot of people out of business. I met a lady in Colorado Springs about 7 weeks ago, now. She had a small business with 63 employees. She finally gave it up. Why? Because of paperwork and regulation. Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act. The President exempts the IRS, which creates threefourths of the paperwork. Were going to get it done; were going to grow some of these jobs in America because we need to get it. Theyre going the wrong way. Well, you may think the biggest employer in America is General Motors, but Ive got news for you. Its manpower services, hiring people temporarily whove lost their jobs and they go to work for 30 days or 60 days. Thats a good economy? I dont think so. Theyre setting new records this year. We have the worst economy in a century. We have the slowest growth, about 2.5 percent. The President inherited a growth of over 5 percent. We dont have the S&L crisis anymore. Republicans have cut $53 billion in spending. Thats why the budget can look good. It didnt look too good the first 2 years when we had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress. Well, Im opposed to discrimination in any form, but Imbut I dont favor creating special rights for any group. That would be my answer to this question. And Imyou know, thered be special rights for different groups in America, but Im totally opposed to discrimination, dont have any policy against hiring anyonewhether its lifestyle or whatever, we dont have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office, nor will we have in the future. But as far as special rights, Im opposed to same-sex marriages, which the President signed well after midnight one morning, in the dark of nighthe opposed it. But Ill get back to the economic package because again, I think this is very important. If there is anything thats going to change America, its get the economy to grow. The President inherited a good economysure. The S&L crisis ended, we were selling assets, we had a Republican Congress cutting spending finally, and he says weve had the best 4 years ever. Thats not true. Weve had over 1.2 million bankruptciesset a new record. Credit card debt has never been higher. I just told you about this manufacturing job loss which is going to increase. We need a good, strong economic package. Let the private sector create the jobs. And they can do it. Thank you. Well, one thing I did was to oppose the Government takeover of health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened. Everybody would have been forced into managed care. You couldnt have chosen your own doctor. And that would have been the end. And I think right now weve got to go back I know theyve appointed a commission to take a look at managed care. Maybe thats part of the answer. But it seems to me, if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, if we eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, youve got to go somewhere else, then I think weve taken a giant step backward in the United States of America. We have the best health care delivery system in the world, and we want to keep it that way. Thats why we opposed the Government takeover health care plan that President Clinton tried and tried and tried to get through Congress. Didnt get it done. When it ended up we had more votes than he had, then they decided to pull the plug. It was a big, big mistake. Now, whether or not hell do that again, Ive heard some of the people say, Well, thats the model we ought to use. And if hes reelected, maybe hell come back and try it again. I hope not. I hope not in both cases. But it does seem to me that youve raised a very important point that needs to be addressed. Were going to have to watch it, going to have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or were going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world. Probably the young people here. Two. Well, I dont have any quarrel with that. I think that would help. But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993. If that isnt a liberal idea, Ive never heard one: 17 new taxes; price controls; 50 new bureaucracies. Wed have that trouble all over America. We need to deal with managed care. It not only happened in California, its happening in other States that we visit too. Its a national problem, not just a State problem. Well, I dont know of any perfect solution. Ive been in politics for some time, and I worry about people who dont vote. And I wonder if its our fault, the candidates fault. People say I dont care. One vote doesnt make a difference. I can give you hundreds of casesyou can probably give me 200 cases where one vote made a difference. I know it made a lot of difference many times in the Congress. Campaign finance might help, might help contributions coming in from Indonesia or other foreign countries, rich people in those countries, and then being sent back after the L.A. Times discovers it$250,000. But maybe there ought to be more debates. Id be willing to have another debate this year where wed invite all of the candidates and talk about the economy. If we dont get the economy to grow, if we dont cut taxes, and give people child credits, and cut the capital gains rate, and get this economy growing, were going to limp into the next century. If we grow the economy, its going to help Social Security, its going to help jobs, its going to help everything. Iris? . Well, we have in our economic pack individual retirement accounts where we think itll encourage savings. You could also use those accounts for health care or education or a first home. Were doing that precisely. And I think one thing sooner or later were going to have to consider is to take a look at the Social Security system, because weve got a lot of people advocating that, well, we dont want to put our money into Social Security. Now, youve got to be very careful about that, because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline. But its something you might consider. Im not suggesting it will be done, but at least we ought to look at it. Its been lookedwhen I was chairman of the Finance Committee, which handles Social Security, we looked at all these options, and one thing weve got to make certainwhen I used to go home, my mother would tell me, All Ive got is my Social Security; dont touch it. And we didnt touch it. We preserved it. And Im an optimist. Your Social Security is going to be there when you retire. Well fix it. It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015. In 1983, we thought we had a 75year fix. It didnt workmuch, much less. But at least we fixed it for some time, and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time. So we need to preserve the system, and we need to make it stronger. But we also need to look at some options whether or not we it would depend on what the options are. In fact, theyve got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options theyre going to present to the next Congress. So I think well wait and see what they present, take a look at it. Did you say youre unemployed? The first thing we ought to do is get you a job. And thats the economic package again: Create jobs and opportunities, reduce the capital gains rate, reduce regulatory reform, stop some of this senseless litigation, and let people work in America. And I think thats the thrust we will make. Obviously, Social Security is a very important program. Itll be preservedDemocrats or Republicans. Itll be preserved. We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline, just as we did back in 1983. And we did it on a bipartisan basis. We took it out of politics. People get so tired of politics. And we ought to do the same with Medicare. Maybe we could make a deal here tonight. Well, the bottom line is weve got to stop exporting jobs. We need to keep jobs here. I said there are 357,000 good jobs, manufacturing jobs, which were lost. And I assume some of those because of our trading partners; we didnt have access to their markets. We ought to insist on access. If we dont have access to their markets the same way they have access to our markets, we ought to say, Wait, thats enough. Time out. When you give us access, well give you access. Its very hard to get into the Japanese market, as everybody knows. They want to get into our market. They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobsthose who sell exports. And its very important to the economy. But I think we want to make certain. I supported the Presidents trade policy, but weve got to be more aggressive. Once you have a policy, then youve got to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy. There are American jobs that are being lost. This is what Ross Perot complains about. And Id say to the Reform Party, take a look at the Republican Party. Were the reform party, and were going to make things better. And one of the things were going to do is stop exporting jobs in America. Hi, Ron. Well, no doubt about it, our Founding Fathers had a great deal of wisdom. And in addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central Government in Washington, DC, that would in effect confiscate your property. So I carry around in my pocketI cant pull it out, Id violate the rulesa copy of the 10th amendment, which says that we ought to return power to the States and power to the peoplepeople here. You ought to make more decisions. Honor, duty, and country: thats what America is all about. Certainly the President of the United States, in the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlierto everyone, by example. And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility. When you have 30-some in your administration whove either left or are being investigated or in jail or whatever, then youve got an ethical problem. Its public ethicsIm not talking about private, were talking about public ethicswhen you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who was a bouncer in a bar and hired as a security officer to collect files. In Watergate, I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file. There are 900 sequestered in the White House900 people like you. Why should they be rifling through your files? So the President has a great responsibility. And its one that I understand and would certainly carry out. Well, I think itsyou know, before I came in tonight, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer because if its Gods will, whatever happensif its Gods will, it will happen. A constitutional amendment for voluntary prayer in school in my view would be a great idea. I support it, and the President opposes it. I mean, it seems to me the President, whoever the President may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities. People look to the President of the United States more than any other person in America. And thats the way its always been, and thats the way it always will be. Well, I hope I made my answer clear. I said Im opposed to discrimination. You know, weve suffered discrimination in the disability community. There are 43 million of us. And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair. So we want to end discrimination. I think that answers itself. No discrimination in America. Weve made that clear. And I would just say that it seems to me that thats the way it ought to be. We shouldnt discriminaterace, color, whatever, lifestyle, disability. This is America, and were all proud of it. But were not there yet. What we need is good, strong leadership going into the next century. Im sorry we didnt have a foreign policy question, because just this week Secretary Christopher said, Well, we really didnt know much the first couple of years about foreign policy. Now, that was quite an admission. It underscores what I had to say in the Hartford debate, that there is really no foreign policy in this administration. Its sort of ad hoc: Whatever comes up, well deal with it. Unfortunately, we didnt have more questions on that. Well, let me thank everybody here at the university, and Jim, thank you, all the people who may still be watching or viewing. This is what its all about. Its not about me. Its not about President Clinton. Its about the process. Its about selecting a President of the United States. So we have our differences. We should have our differences. I mentioned other parties. They have their differences. If we all agreed, itd be a pretty dull place. We should have more debates. Maybe well have another debate on the economy. But I would just say this: This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, somebody whose parents didnt finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, somebody who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed, somebody who understands that there are real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms or the single parents or families working or seniors or people with disabilities, whoever it may be. But there are some very fundamental differences in this campaign. President Clinton opposes term limits. President Clinton opposes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. President Clinton opposes a voluntary prayer amendment. He opposes an amendment to protect the flag of the United States of America. People give their livesa couple of servicemen herethey sacrifice, they give everything for America. We ought to protect the American flag with a constitutional amendment. But beyond that, we need to address the economy. And I would just say, with my time running out here, its a very proud moment for me. And what I want the voters to do is to make a decision. And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead, proud that they voted for the right candidate, proud that they voted, hopefully, for me. And Ill just make you one promise. My word is good. Democrats and Republicans have said Bob Doles word is good. I keep my word. I promise you, the economy is going to get better, were going to have a good economic package, and were going into the next century a better America. Thank you. \"\"\",\"\"\"We will follow a townhall-type format tonight. The questions over the next 90 minutes will come from 113 citizens of the greater San Diego area. They were chosen in the past week by the Gallup organization to represent a rough cross-section of voters as to political views, age, gender, and other factors. Each said he or she is undecided about this Presidential race. They were told to come tonight with questions. Nobody from the Debate Commission or the two campaigns has any idea what those questions are; neither do I. We will all be hearing them for the first time at the same time. I met with this group 3 hours ago, and we spoke only about how it was going to work tonight. They are sitting in five sections. I will call on individuals at random, moving from one section to another with each new question, alternating the questions between the two candidates. My job is to keep things fair and the subjects as clear and as varied as possible. The rules, drawn by the campaigns, are basically the same as they were for the Hartford and St. Petersburg debates: 90-second answers, 60-second rebuttals, 30-second responses for each question. The candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. There will be 2-minute opening and closing statements. The order for this evening was set by coin toss. We begin now with Senator Dole and his opening statement. Senator Dole. Mr. President, 2 minutes, opening statement. All right, lets go now to the first question from this section, and its for Senator Dole. Yes, maam? Yes? Mr. President? Senator? All right, the next question from this section right here. Right there in the middle, sir. Yes, sir? The next question is for Senator Dole from here. Yes, sir? Senator Dole? Next question here for President Clinton. Yes, maam, here on the front row. All right, next question from this section, and it is for Senator Dole. Back in the back. Yes, sir, right there. Yes, sir. The next question is for President Clinton, and it comes from right here. Yes, sir? My question is this: Assuming you agree that our entitlement programs are on an unsustainable course, what specific reforms do you propose? Next question from here, and its for Senator Dole. Yes, maam, right here. Yes. President Clinton? This section, question? Yes, maam, on the back row. This is for the President. Senator Dole. All right. The next question is for Senator Dole. Yes, maam, right there. Next question is for President Clinton, and its fromyes, maam? Yes? Senator Dole. All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and it comes from this section right here. The back row, there, in the blue shirt. Yes, sir. Sir. The next question is for the President. Yes, sir, right therewhite shirt. Next question for Senator Dole. This side. Yes, maam. The next question is for President Clinton. Yes, sir? Senator Dole? Mr. President? The next question is for Senator Dole and its from this section. Yes, maam? Yes? Senator Dole? The next question is for President Clinton, and in this section. Yes, maam. Yes. And if we in fact are going to bring the country back together and be all faces around the table, the new American family, what do you see as something the President can do to begin that process to bring them back in? For Senator Dole, in this section. On the back row, yes, maam. All right, the question is for President Clinton. Does anybody have a foreign affairs question in this section? Yes, sir. Senator? All right, the next question is for Senator Dole, and its in this section. Yes, sir. All right, this is our last question. It goes to President Clinton, and its from this section. Yes, maam? President Clinton, perhaps you can help me with something tonight. Ive heard Mr. Dole say several times, all of us together. And when he was asked if he would support equal rights in employment for gay and lesbian people, you said that you favored that, and he said that he did not believe in special rights. And I thought the question was equal rights for all people, and I dont understand why people are using the term special rights when the question is equal rights. Could you help me in understanding that? Senator Dole? All right. Now we go to the closing statements. Senator Dole, youre first. Two minutes, sir. Mr. President. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President. This concludesthis is the last of the three 1996 Presidential and Vice Presidential debates.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 6 1996,The President,Senator Dole,\"\"\"Thank you, Jim, and thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts. I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service, and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults. Four years ago I ran for President at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration. I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted a Government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people have the tools to make the most of their own lives. Four years ago you took me on faith. Now theres a record: 10 1/2 million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace. We are better off than we were 4 years ago. Lets keep it going. We cut the deficit by 60 percent. Now lets balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans. Now lets pass the tax cuts for education and childrearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home. We passed family and medical leave. Now lets expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force. We passed the 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady bill. Now lets keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs. We passed welfare reform. Now lets move a million people from welfare to work. And most important, lets make education our highest priority so that every 8-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log on to the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college. We can build that bridge to the 21st century, and I look forward to discussing exactly how were going to do it. Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal Government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. That, to me, is the key. And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole. For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal Government to its smallest size in 30 years. Weve reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the family and medical leave law, the Brady bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed, that I supported because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. Ive worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the Vchip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when theyre young, along with the ratings system for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed that they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future. I trust the people. Weve done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives. But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries. I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which states you cant lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family has been sick. Our Government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the States than its two predecessors under Republican Presidents. But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st century. I agree with that. Thats right. Well, let me say, first of all, in February, Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape its been in in 30 years. We have 10 1/2 million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s. Wages are going up for the first time in a decade. We have record number of new small businesses. We had the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. All groups of people are growingwe had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995. The average familys income has gone up over $1,600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think its clear that were better off than we were 4 years ago. Now we need to focus on, what do we need to do to be better off still? How can we help peopleas we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children? Thats what I want to focus on. But were clearly better off than we were 4 years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year. Absolutely not. Lets look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole has been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 Members. He said he did the right thing then; he knew it wouldnt work at the time. Thats what he said. Then his budget, that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich, cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare Trust Fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs, as well as more in premiums, because doctors could have charged them more. The American Hospital Association, the nurses association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed. And now, with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Doles, even his own friendshis campaign cochair, Senator DAmato, says that they cant possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him. Now, my balanced budget plan adds 10 years to the life of the Medicare Trust Fund10 years. And well have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers. But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion, to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always have to reform it over the years, but we need someone who believes in it to reform it. Well, let me say first of all, Id be happy to have a commission deal with this, and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the 83 Social Security commission. But it wont be possible to do if his tax scheme passes, because even his own campaign cochair, Senator DAmato, says hell have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed. I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system. My balanced budget plan puts 10 years onto Medicare. We ought to do that; then we can have a commission. But Senator Doles plans are not good for the country. Me too? Thats good. I need it. Well, heres the problem with it. It sounds very good, but theres a reason that 500 economists, including 7 Nobel Prize winners, and business periodicals like Business Week and even Senator Doles friend Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican Senator from New Hampshire, says it is not a practical program. Its a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit, which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. Its not good to raise the deficit; weve worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on 9 million people. And in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great. But our targeted tax cut for education, childrearing, health care, and homebuying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plansomething that he has not done certified by the Congressional Budget Office, thats the right way to go. Well, I try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible, tell people what I stand for, and let them decide whether theyre going to support me or not. The Senator mentioned the trial lawyers. In the case of the product liability bill, which they passed and I vetoedI think thats what hes talking about I actually wanted to sign that bill, and I told the people exactly whatthe Congressexactly what kind of bill I would sign. Now, a lot of the trial lawyers didnt want me to sign any bill at all, but I thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits. But they wouldnt make some of the changes that I thought should be made. And let me just give you an example. I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a schoolbus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the schoolbus. The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress, and I said, Prove to me that these people could recover, but were going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits; Ill sign the bill. But generally, I believe that a President has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. Ive done a lot of things that were controversial: my economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know its right for the country over the long run. Thats what Ive tried to do, and thats what I will continue to do as President. Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago. Ive proved that I will sign reasonable tort reform. Secondly, Senator Dole has had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasnt me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who are subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up to the Federal Government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children. And it wasnt me that let the polluters actually come into the Halls of Congress, into the rooms, and rewrite the environmental laws. Thats what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me. So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each others motivations. I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree. Mr. Lehrer, I hope well have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program, but let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggesteda gentleman that, unfortunately, just passed away a couple of days ago suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it, and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Doles ardent supporter Senator McCain, who is out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supportedsponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it, and members of Senator Doles own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that Ive had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly. I agree. Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about whats happened. I am. But lets look at the overall record. Overall in America, cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last 4 years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs, up to about 11 percent total with marijuana. And I regret it. Let me tell you what Ive tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general, who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country, as our Nations drug czarthe most heavily decorated soldier in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a crime bill that had 60 death penalties, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in the safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the D.A.R.E. program, because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still dont understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you, even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them? I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I dont think this issue should be politicized, because my record is clear and I dont think Senator Dole supports using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isnt dangerous and wont kill them and wont destroy their lives get the message and change. Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the Governor, just like this one answers to the President. Thats what I thought we ought to do. Secondly, Senator Dole, you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it, and you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act. I dont think that means youre soft on drugs. We just have a different approach. But let me remind you that my family has suffered from drug abuse. I know what its like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives, and I hate drugs, Senator. We need to do this together, and we can. Let me say, first of all, Senator Dole has gone back and forth about whether hed be for repealing the Brady bill or repealing the assault weapons ban, and I think his present position is that he would not do so. And if thats true, Im grateful for it. But lets look at the facts here. The Brady bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from getting handguns. Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady bill. He tried to keep it from coming to my desk. He didnt succeed, and I signed it, and Im glad I did. Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didnt want the assault weapons ban, just like they didnt want the Brady bill. But 2 years later, nobody has lost their handgunsI mean, their rifles. Weve expanded the Brady bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids. And this is a safer country. So Im glad I took on that fight. And I believe, with all respect, I was right, and he was wrong. If thats what he said, hes not right about that. Look at where we are today. The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the cold war and on the brink of the 21st century. I have worked to support our country as the worlds strongest force for peace and freedom, prosperity and security. We have done the following things: Number one, weve managed the aftermath of the cold war, supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in Russia, the removal of Russian troops from the Baltics, the integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO and, I might add, with a democratic Russia. There are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the United States tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. We have worked hard for peace and freedom. When I took office, Haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the United States. When I took office, the worst war in Europe was waging in Bosnia. Now there is a democratically elected President in Haiti, peace in Bosnia. We have just had elections there. We have made progress in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. Weve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime. And we have worked hard to expand Americas economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade, with the largest number of new trade agreements in history. Thats one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again. First of all, I take full responsibility for what happened in Somalia, but the American people must remember that those soldiers were under an American commander when that happened. I believe they did the best they could under the circumstances. And lets not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there. Secondly, in Haiti, political violence is much, much smaller than it was. Thirdly, in Bosnia, its a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war. And at least there has now been an election, and the institutions are beginning to function. In Northern Ireland and the Middle East, we are better off than we were 4 years ago. There will always be problems in this old world, but if were moving in the right direction and America is leading, were better off. Our military is the strongest military in the world. It is the strongest, best prepared, best equipped it has ever been. There is very little difference in the budget that I have proposed and the Republican budget over the next 6-year period. We are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system. I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training. That is my solemn obligation. You asked, when do you decide to deploy them? The interests of the American people must be at stake; our values must be at stake; we have to be able to make a difference. And frankly, we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform. But I believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful in Haiti, in Bosnia, when we moved to Kuwait to repel Saddam Husseins threatened invasion of Kuwait, when I have sent the fleet into the Taiwan Straits, when weve worked hard to end the North Korean nuclear threat. I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources. Well, first of all, for the last 4 years we have worked hard to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and a move toward democracy. In 1992, before I became President, Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act, and I enforced it vigorously. We made the embargo tougher, but we increased contacts, people to people, with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community. Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international airspace. They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation. Senator Dole is correct. I did give about 6 months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though theyre effective now and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba. And the United States needs help from other countries. Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now. But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy. Every single country in Latin America, Central America, and the Caribbean is a democracy tonight but Cuba. And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well. There were several off-the-subject whoppers in that litany. Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. His running mate, Jack Kemp, once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didnt hike. [Laughter] And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic Party or this administration, that the 82 tax increase he sponsored, in inflationadjusted dollars, was the biggest tax increase in American history. So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here. Well, that sounds very good, but its very wrong. Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a health care bill in 199493but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no, because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big Government and make sure nothing was done to aid health care before the 94 elections so they could make that claim. Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew. But were pursuing a step-by-step reform now. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family has been sick. I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries where insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours. And I vetoed Senator Doles Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine. Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances. Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or repress his own citizens. Unfortunately, a lot of people have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and weve been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now. What happened was, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north. But we felt, since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something. We did not feel that I could commitI certainly didnt feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that. So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors. We did that by expanding whats called the no-fly zone, by increasing our allies control of the airspace, now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad. Was it the right thing to do? I believe it was. Is it fully effective? Did it make him withdraw from the north? Well, he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue. We have learned that if you give him an inch hell take a mile. We had to do something. And even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do. Senator Dole has, two or three times before, tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now Im being criticized for not working with the U.N. Sometimes the United States has to act alone, or at least has to act first. Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy. I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq; that would have been wrong. I could reduce Saddam Husseins ability to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again. Thats what I did. I still believe it was the right thing to do. We have a very consistent policy in the Middle East: It is to support the peace process, to support the security of Israel, and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace. It is a very difficult environment. The feelings are very strong. There are extremists in all parts of the Middle East who want to kill that peace process. Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace. I would liked to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other rapidly. Innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying. So much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government. I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say, lets stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus. Now, today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East, and theyve started negotiations. And all of those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again. Well, Im saying that Senator Dole said in his fine speech in San Diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past. And I think I know what he meant by that. He is troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today. But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future. Thats why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this old, stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long, to get this country moving again. And thats why weve got a country with 10 1/2 million more jobs and record numbers of new businesses and rising incomes and falling crime rates and welfare roll rates. Thats why were moving in the right direction. And Im trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that. Thats why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy. Thats why I want a tax cut for education and childrearing, but its got to be paid for. Thats why I want to continue the work we have done, over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again. These are my commitments. I am very oriented toward the future. I think this election has to be geared toward the future. I think Americas best days are still ahead. But weve got to build the right bridge. I do not for a moment think Im entitled to all the credit for the good things that have happened in America. But where I have moved to work with the American people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives, I think I should get some credit for that. I also personally took responsibility tonight when Senator Dole asked me about the drug problem. But you know, I think my ideas are better for the future. Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Head Start, against creating the Department of Education. If he gets elected President, well start the new century without anyone in the Cabinet of the President representing education and our children. I personally dont think thats the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack. Let me say, first of all, Im all for students having more choices. Weve worked hard to expand public school choice. In my balanced budget bill there are funds for 3,000 new schools, created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools, that have no rules. Theyre free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children. The ones that are out there are doing well. What Im against is Senator Doles plan to take money away from all of the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer. If were going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the State level. But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education. He voted against student loans, he voted against my improved student loan plan, he voted against the national service bill, against the Head Start bill. He voted against our efforts in safe and drug-free schools. He has voted against these programs. He does not believe it. Thats the issue. Ninety percent of our kids are out there in those public schools, and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those Ive outlined in this campaign. I support school choice. I support school choice. I have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and, I said, the creation of 3,000 new schools that we are going to help the States to finance. But if youre going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by States and localities where theyre raising and spending most of the money. I simply think its wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids90 percent of them are in the public schoolsto take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards. Our schools are getting better. And our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level. I have been a strong force for reform. And Senator, I remind you that a few years ago, when I supported a teacher testing law in my home State, I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association. I just dont believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the Republican Convention. I think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward. And let me just say, that budget you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Head Start. It would have eliminated the AmeriCorps plan. And it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships. Now, it would have; thats a fact. Thats one of the big reasons I vetoed it. We need to be doing more in education, not less. First of all, Senator Dole, lets set the record straight. I was able, for 2 years when I was a very young boy, to go to a Catholic school, but I basically went to public schools all my life. And Ive worked hard for a long time to make them better. Ninety percent of our kids are there. Its amazing to meyou are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools, where we dont have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education. We ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private school choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it. I might say, the results are highly ambiguous. But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children. And thats why I vetoed the budget that you passed with $30 billion in education cuts. It was wrong, and my plan for the future is better. When Senator Dole made that remark about all the elitists, young elitists in the administration, one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said, Mr. President, I know how you grew up. Who is he talking about? And you know, this liberal charge, thats what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race. Its sort of their golden oldie, you know, its a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear. [Laughter] And I just dont think that dog will hunt this time. The American people can make up their mind about whether thats a liberal record or a record thats good for America. Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it. I believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives, to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility, and to build a sense of community so were all working together. I dont believe in discrimination. I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy. I believe that we have to do these things with a Government thats smaller and less bureaucratic, but that we have to do them nonetheless. Its inconvenient for Senator Dole, but the truth is Ive reduced the size of Government more than my Republican predecessors. And I did stop them, I admit that; I sure stopped their budget. Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within 4 miles of a toxic waste dumpby a third. It ended the principle of the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent. Their budget weakened our support for education $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare. And finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of health care to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women. It was wrong for the country, and calling it conservative wont make it right. It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadnt stopped it. The way to get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment; to give a targeted tax cutand let me talk about the education tax cutto let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar-for-dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody; and then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, homebuying, or medical expenses. Thats the right way to go into the 21st century: balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme. Well, just for the record, when I was a Governor, we had the lowestsecond lowest tax burden of any State in the country, the highest job growth rate of any State when I ran for President, and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances. But the important thing is, what are we going to do now? I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and childrearing, with the rest of the education planhooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000, making sure weve got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our 8-year-olds can learn to read; investing in our environment, cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps. Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme. Now, remember, folks, even Senator Doles campaign cochair, Senator DAmato, says hes got to cut Medicare to pay for this. Everybody who has looked at it, 500 economists, 7 Nobel Prize winners, say its bad for the economy. Its going to blow a hole in the deficit, raise taxes on 9 million people, and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed. Our plan is better. It will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families. Well, first of all, he made that remark about Senator DAmato. Hes arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator DAmato in the last couple of years, and so Im more familiar with his comments than I used to be. [Laughter] Let me say what Ive said already about this pardon issue. This is an issue they brought up. There has been no consideration of it, no discussion of it. Ill tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment, and I will strictly adhere to the law. And that is what every President has done, as far as I know, in the past. But whatever other Presidents have done, this is something I take seriously, and thats my position.  Thats right. Thank you. No comment. [Laughter] Id like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side and to move this country forward, and were better off than we were 4 years ago. But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st century is a better plan: a targeted tax cut; a real commitment to educational reform; a deep commitment to making welfare reform work, with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to worknow we have to create those jobs, now that were requiring people to go to work; a commitment to step-by-step health care reform, with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access health care and not lose it just because theyre out of work for a while; a commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment. Thats what Id like them to know about me, that Ive gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true. And I believe weve got the results to show were on the right track. The most important thing is I believe weve got the right ideas for the future. And like Senator DoleI like Senator Dole. You can probably tell we like each other. We just see the world in different ways, and you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right. Lets look at that. When I ran for President, I said wed cut the deficit in half in 4 years; weve cut it by 60 percent. I said that our economic plan would produce 8 million jobs; we have 10 1/2 million new jobs. Were number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses. I said wed pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins. And we did that. I said we would change the way welfare works. And even before the bill passed, we had moved nearly 2 million people from welfare to work, working with States and communities. I said wed get tougher on child support, and child support enforcement is up 50 percent. I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans. The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be, and I think theyre better off, all of us are, that we got those interest rates down and the deficit down. The Republicans talk about it, but were the first administration in anybodys lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down 4 years in a row. We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans. And now Ive got a plan that has been out there for 2 years it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the Government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldnt take that. But well get the rest of that tax relief. And so I think when you can look at those results, you know that the plan I have laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if youll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st century. I think a lot of people deserve credit, and Ive tried to give it to them. But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Doles ill-advised $550 billion scheme, which I will say again will blow a hole in the deficit. Our plan will balance the budget and grow the economy, preserve the environment, and invest in education. We have the right approach for the future. And look at the results: It is not midnight in America, Senator. We are better off than we were 4 years ago. Well, first, Jim, let me thank you, and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight, for the chance youve given us to appear. I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as President for the last 4 years. I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and Ive done my best to be faithful to the charge youve given me. Im proud of the fact that America is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were 4 years ago. Im glad were going in the right direction. And Ive done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century. Id like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as President are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesnt happen in this country: the autoworker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job, because were number one in auto production again; all the people Ive met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their childrenand I think what others could do for our country and for themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way. I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer, and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job, because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I think of all the people that I grew up with and went to school with whom I stay in touch with and who never let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America. Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across. And I hope that you will help me build it. \"\"\",\"\"\"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words. And I thank the people of Hartford, the commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching. Its a great honor for me to be here, standing here as the Republican nominee. Im very proud to be the Republican nominee, reaching out to Democrats and independents. I have three very special people with me: my wife, Elizabeth, my daughter, Robin, who have never let me down; and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, who along with Ollie Manninen helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back. Ive learned from them that people do have tough times and sometimes you cant go it alone. And thats what Americas all about. I remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in Chicago named Dr. Kelikian, and ever since that time Ive tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight. America is the greatest place on the face of the Earth. And I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table. You worry about the quality and the safety of your children and the quality of education. But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had. And Jack Kemp and I want to share with you some ideas tonight. Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job. Now, Im a plain-speaking man, and I learned long ago that your word was your bond. And I promise you tonight that Ill try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them. Its a tall order, but Ive been running against the odds for a long time. And again, Im honored to be here this evening. I think the basic difference is and I have had some experience in thisI think the basic differenceI trust the people; the President trusts the Government. If you go back and look at the health care plan that he wanted to impose on the American peopleone-seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies, a cost of $1.5 trillion. Dont forget that; that happened in 1993. A tax increase that taxed everybody in America, not just the rich. If you made $25,000thats the original proposalyou got your Social Security taxes increased. We had a BTU tax that turned into a $35 billion gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase. I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card around in my pocket called the 10th amendment. Where possible, I want to give power back to the States and back to the people. Thats my difference for the present, and well have specific differences later. He noted a few, but there are others. Well, hes better off than he was 4 years ago. [Laughter] And I may be better off 4 years from now. But[laughter]I dont know, I look at the slowest growth in a century. He inherited a growth of 4.7, 4.8 percent; now its down to about 2.4 percent. Were going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. Weve got stagnant wages; in fact, womens wages have dropped 2.2 percent. Mens wages havent gone up, gone down. So we have stagnation. We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look are you better off? Well, I guess some may be better off. Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was 4 years ago. Rene Preval is probably better off than he was 4 years ago. But are the American people? Theyre working harder and harder and paying more taxes. For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn, more than you spend for food, clothing, and shelter combined, for taxes under this administration. So some may be better off. They talk about family income being up. Thats not true in Connecticut; family income is down. And its up in some cases because both parents are working; one works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the Government. Were going to give them a tax cut so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. Thats what America is all about. I doubt that I acknowledged that this year, but in any event, I think we just look at the facts. We ask the people that are viewing tonight, Are you better off than you were 4 years ago? Its not whether were better off; its whether theyre better off. Are you working harder to put food on the table, to feed your children? Are your children getting a better education? Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America. Crime has gone down, but its because of mayors like Rudy Giuliani, where one-third of the drop happened in one city, New York City. So, yes, some may be better off. But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from our economic package, theyll be better off when Bob Dole is President and Jack Kemp is Vice President. Well, I must say I looked back at the vote on Medicare in 1965we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and was means-tested so people who needed medical attention received it. I thought it was a good program. But I have supported Medicare ever since. In fact, I used to go home and my mother would tell mesaid, Bob, all Ive got is my Social Security and my Medicare. Dont cut it. I wouldnt violate anything my mother said. In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House. Im concerned about health care. Ive had the best health care in Government hospitals, Army hospitals, and I know its importance. But weve got to fix it. Its his trustees, the Presidents trustees, not mine, who say its going to go broke. He doesnt fix it for 10 years. We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did with Social Security in 1983 when we rescued Social Security. And I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida. And we can do it again if we take politics out of it. Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. Youve already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think its time to have a truce. Oh, yes, and youll be eligible. [Laughter] And so will the former President, yes. [Laughter] Well, the people need it; thats the point. This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut. Fifteen percent acrosslets take a family making $30,000 a yearthats $1,261. Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial thats not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working familythats 4 or 5 months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it may be 3 or 4 months of mortgage payments. This economic package is about families, but its a six-point package. First of all, its a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way. We lost by one vote. The President wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next 6 years. I want to increase spending 14 percent. Thats how simple it is. I want the Government to pinch pennies for a change, instead of the American families. Were talking about 6 percentage points over 6 years. And with that money, you give it back to the working people. You also provide opportunity scholarships so low-income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools. And it will work. And when it does work, Mr. President, I know you will congratulate me. You mean, how does he avoid the conflict? Well, I dont know in the case of the trial lawyers. When I look at the trial lawyers, and when youre a few million short you run out to Hollywood and pick up $2 million to $4 million, and organized labor comes to Washington, DC, and puts $35 million into the potnow, if these arent special interests, then Ive got a lot to learn. I was there for a while before I left on June 11th. The trial lawyersI dontmy wife is a lawyer. Were the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other, but were lawyers. I like lawyers. I dont dislike trial lawyers. But it seems to me there has got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits, and theres got to be some cap on punitive damage. Youre putting a lot of business people out of business, small-business men and small-business women who paid 70 percent of your $265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day, and Pat Moynihanand the Democrats say nohe said, in the history of the world. So I modified itthe largest tax increase in the history of the world. And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President. And I will address you as Mr. President. You didnt do that with President Bush in 1992. Thats not true. I think its very difficult. Lets be honest about it. Thats why we need campaign finance reform. Thats why I reach out to the Perot voters, and weve done about all thatwe are the reform party, the Republican Party, and the Perot voters who are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record. Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in 92, its all done but campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup. We tried 6 or 8 years ago tohe appointed three people, I appointed three peopleto get campaign finance reform. We couldnt get it done because it wasnt enforceable. You suggested a commission; Newt Gingrich did. Ive suggested that, at least 4 or 5 years ago, we have a commission on campaign finance reform, they send it to Congress, and we have to vote it up or down. Thats how it works. Were never going to fix it by the parties, because Democrats want a better advantage for themselves, we want a better advantage as Republicans, and thats not how its going to work. But I want to touch on this tobacco thing. I know the Presidents been puffing a lot on that. But I want to go back to 1965. That was my first vote against tobacco companies when I said we ought to label cigarettes, and Ive had a consistent record ever since 1965. We passed a bill in 1992 to encourage the States to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking. All 50 States did it. It took 3 1/2 years. It wasnt until election year, Mr. President, that you ever thought about stopping smoking. What about drugs that have increaseddoubled in the last 44 months? Cocaine is up 141 percentor marijuana; cocaine up 166 percent. And it seems to me that you have a selective memory. Mine doesnt work that way, so I just want to try to correct it as we go along. Well, on campaign reform itself were going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics, get people who dont have any interest in politics but understand the issue, and let them make a recommendation to Congress. Now, were not kidding anybody, Mr. President. These are sophisticated people watching tonight, millions and millions of Americans. They know the Republican Party hasnt done it. They know the Democratic Party wont do it. We ought to agree that somebody else should do it, and then we have to vote it up or down. Again, youre very selective, Mr. President. You dont want to politicize drugs, but its all right to politicize Medicare and go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell grants and things like this. I mean, you say we have done all these bad things, which isnt the case. But it seems to me the record is clear. The record was pretty clear in Arkansas when you were Governor: Drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. But here you cut the drug czars office 83 percent. You have cut interdiction substantially. Thats whatI want to stop it from coming across the border. And in my administration were going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is an invasion of drugs from all over the world. And we have a responsibility. You had a Surgeonor before General McCaffrey, you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need? And I wont comment on other things that have happened in your administration or your past about drugs. But it seems to me the kids ought toif they have started they ought to stop, and just dont do it. Not if I didnt have a better idea, but Ive got a better idea. Its something Ive worked on for 15 years. Its called the automated check or the instant check. Its being used in 17 States right now, States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other States. You dont buy any gunyou dont get any gun. Weve got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, DC, of people who should not have a gun. We ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, and there are eight other categories that should not have guns. Ive been working on this for a long, long time. You walk in, you put your little card in there. If it says tilt, you dont get any gun. You dont get a handgun; you dont get a rifle; you dont get a shotgun. You get zippo. If were going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, weve got to stop guns from being dumped on the street. The administration says they support the instant check. Theyve appropriated about $200 million but only spent about $3 million to get it underway. In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite this. It keeps up the technology. It keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns. That is the bottom line. And I believe its a good idea. It has strong bipartisan support, and perhaps thats another thing we can depoliticize. You talk about the Brady bill. Theres only been one prosecution under the Brady bill only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady bill that you talk about all the time. And on the assault weapons ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only 6 are banned now because 11 have been modified and theyre back on the street. Lets get together on this instant check, because that will really make a difference. Well, the President doesnt have it quite right. I mean, it seemed to me at the time that the assault weapon ban was not effective. But thats history. As I told the NRA, thats history: Youre not going to worry about it anymore; Im not going to worry about it anymore. Lets do something better. Lets stop playing the political game, Mr. President, talking about this and this. You add up all the States who have used the instant check and how many weapons theyve kept out of the hands of criminals, it would far surpass the number you mentioned. So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole, and well get the instant check passed, and well keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Well, I have a different view again. Ive supported the President on Bosnia. And I think we were told the troops would be out in a year. Now I understand its been extended till sometime next year. But lets start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets and where 18 Americans were killed one day because they didnt havethey were pinned down for 8 hours, the Rangers; they didnt have the weapons; they didnt have the tanks. They asked for the tanks. They didnt get the tanks from this administration, because we were nation building. Its called mission creep. We turned it over to the United Nations. The President didnt have much to do about it. Look at Haiti, where weve spent about $3 billion, and we got an alarm call there about 2 weeks ago: Youve got to send down some more people because the President has found out there are death squads on his own property, so we need more protection from America. Bosnia, Northern Irelandthere is no ceasefire in Bosnia. I think there are still lots of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselvesthe policy you had when you ran in 1992. We havent done that. Were way behind, which means Americans cant come home. Americans shouldnt have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations Charter. Well, after World War I we had a policy of disengagement. Then from World War I to World War II we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy. Now, I think we have to have a selective engagement policy. We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations interests. And many of the things the President talked about he turned over to the United Nations; they decided. Hes deployed more troops than any President in history around the world. Its cost us billions and billions of dollars for peacekeeping operations. These are facts. And it seems to me that when you make a decision, the decision is made by the President of the United States, by the Commander in Chief. He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go around and defend our liberty and our freedom. That would be my position. Then Im going to have a top-down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom-up review where you all fight over how much money is there. I want a top-down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense and then follow that policy, instead of this bottom-up review with all of the services fighting for the money. The President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion; he cut defense $112 billion, devastated States like California and others. And I think now weve got a problem. Weve got to go back and look. Its just like you said in Texas one day, you know, you raised taxes too muchand you didand you cut defense too much, Mr. Presidentand you didand you may have said that, too. But the bottom line is, we are the strongest nation in the world, we provide the leadership, and were going to have to continue to provide the leadership. But lets do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows a whistle at the United Nations. Well, I failed to mention North Korea and Cuba a while ago. You look at North Korea, where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs, where weve sort of distanced ourselves from our ally, South Korea. They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean war, the forgotten war. We lost 53,000 Americans. We shouldnt be doing any favors for North Korea. Its a closed society. We dont have any inspection. We dont know whether its going to work or not. But we keep giving them these incentivessome would call them something elseincentives. We dont know whats going to happen. Here we have Cuba, 90 miles from our shores. And what have we done? Weve passed a law that gave people the right to sue, and the President postponed it for 6 months. And it seems to me if you want to send a signal youve got to send a signal, Mr. President. The sooner, the better off well be if we put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him. Well, thats the point I made; we have to be firm and strong. And I hope that will happen. It will happen starting next January and maybe can happen the balance of this year. We have not been firm and strong. If you look at the poor people who still live in Cuba, its a haven for drug smugglers, and we dont have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro. In my view, the policy has failed. So Congress passes a law, the President signs it like he does a lot of things, but helike welfare reform, Well, Im going to sign it, but Im going to try to change it next year. I mean, a lot of these election-year conversions the President is talking aboutall the drug money and all the other things, all this antismoking campaignall happened in 1996. And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record. When he fought a balanced budget amendment, when he gave you that biggest tax increase in history, when he tried to take over your health care system, when he fought regulatory reform that costs the average family $6,000 to $7,000 a yearthis is serious business. Its about your family. Its about your business. And in this case, its about a firmer policy with Cuba. Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut. You know, we were closing loopholes; we were going after big corporations. I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system. And we will have a fairer, flatter system, and were going to make the economic package work. Health care: Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system that took over about one-seventh the economy, that put on price controls, created all these State alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. Theyre going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is President. We wont threaten anybody. So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill; that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. Weve been for that for 4, 5, or 6 years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days because he wasnt satisfied with one provision. But it will cover a preexisting condition. If you change your job youre going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill that we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal Government. But then, of course, you had a Democratic Congress, and they didnt want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congresswe finally got action, and Im very proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight. Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisionsmy provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people who are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of what you pay for premiums; you can also deduct long-term care now. So its a good start. I thinkwere even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package. There may be a way there to reach out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in this country, particularly children, that should be covered. Another way you can do it is to expand Medicaid. In America, no one will go without health care, no one will go without food Food. [Laughter] Well, the Presidents own CIA Director says that Saddam is stronger now than he was. And I dont understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north. And what weve doneduring the Bush administration the Kurds were at the State Department negotiating, trying to work their differences out. Now weve got allthousands and thousands of refugees. Were even shipping, I guess, 3,000 Kurds to Guam. It involves Turkey. Its a real problem, and Saddam is probably stronger than he ever was. We shot, what, 44 cruise missilestheyre worth about $1.2 million apieceand hit some radar thatrepaired in a couple, 3 days. Did we inflict any damage? No. Did we have any of our allies helping? Well, we have Great Britain. Theyre always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait, even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming. They didnt even understand that. We had to get their permission. The bottom line is, we went in there alone. Were supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution. We did it without any of our allies that helped us in the Gulf. Thats not the U.N. Not mine. Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category? I dont know. I want to be very serious. I have supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia; I supported him on NAFTA and GATT. So its not that we always disagree; others disagreed with us. The Mideast is very difficult. But it seemed to me just as an observer that before you would call somebody to America, you would have some notion what the end result might be. Now, maybe its better just to get together and sit down and talk; maybe that was the purpose. And I know talks have [inaudible]started again today. But again, its almost like an ad hoc foreign policy. Its ad hoc. Its sort of, Well, we get up in the morning and read the papers and what countrys in trouble; well have a meeting. To me, thats not the strategy that I think that people expect from America. I think we have lost credibility. And I say this very honestly, without any partisanship. Weve lost credibility around the world. Our allies donttheyre not certain what were going to do, what our reaction, what our response is going to be. Nobody suggested sending troops to Iraq, if that was the hint there from the President. But I do think that Saddam Hussein is stronger than he was, and I do believe that we didnt gain a great deal in the Mideast by bringing three of the four leadersone refused to cometo Washington, DC. Well, I was disappointed the President did not call for an unconditional end to the violence. I mean, it seemed to me the violence would stop when these leaders came to America. The killing and the tragedies had taken place, and its unfortunate. And it is a difficult area, no doubt about it. It shouldnt be politicized in any way, by the President or by his opponent, and I dont intend to politicize it. I hope that they have talked, and I hope theyve reached some result and that the killing will end. You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother, Kenny, who is no longer alive, but Kenny was a great talker. And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate, so we always had a rule, we divided by 6. Now, maybe in your case, maybe just 2. But 11 million new jobs and everythingI mean, the President cant take credit for everything that Governors are doing or thats happening in New York City when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen, whether its drug use or something else in America. And so it seems to me that we can talk aboutwell, we called Kenny the great exaggerator because he just liked to make it sound a little better; it made him feel better. When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future. I also want a bridge to the truth. We have to tell the truth. Weve got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth. And the truth is, theres a lot wrong with America. We need a strong economic package. We need a tax cut. We need the $500 child credit. And well have that soon. Yes. I didnt favor it when it was started. I voted against it. It was a tribute after President Carters election to the National Education Association, who sent a lot of delegates to the Democratic Convention, who give 99.5 percent of their money to Democrats and the President. And a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools. So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships. Now, some say, Oh, youre Republican; you cant be reaching out to these people. Ive reached out to people all my life. Ive worked on the food stamp program proudly and the WIC program and the school lunch program with Senators like George McGovern, Hubert Humphrey, and others, to name a few of my Democratic friends. Im not some extremist out here. I care about people. I have my own little foundation thats raised about $10 million for the disabled. I dont advertise itjust did, havent before. I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people. So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships, and tell little Landel Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father youre going to get to go to school because were going to match what the State puts up, and youre going to get to go to the school of your choice. I dont fault the President or the Vice President for sending their children to private schools or better schools; I applaud them for it. I dont criticize them. But why shouldnt everybody have that choice? Why shouldnt low-income Americans and low-middle-income Americans? Im excited about it. Its going to be a big, big opportunity for a lot of people. I had better correct the President. I dont know what time it is, but its probably getting late. But I want to correctall of these things I voted against, they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldnt have had, and we probably voted no. Ive supported all of the education programs; Ive supported Head Start. I think we ought to look at it. So I dont want anybody out there to think that weve just been voting no, no, no. Lets give low-income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools. Lets turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the National Education Association. Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if thats one of your successes I wouldnt speak about it too loudly. Its cost about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer. Weve got 4 million young people volunteering every year. The number hasnt gone down. And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering. I like young people. I like teachers. Im a product of public schools. You attended a private school for some time in your life. I like teachers. Youre not for school choice. You cant be for school choice, because its that special interest money again. When youre getting 99.5 percent of the moneywe dont know what happened to the other .5 percent; were looking for it. Somebody got it. But it all went to Democrats, and this is part of that liberal establishment, one of those liberal things that you just cant do. Youre for school uniforms and curfews, and youre opposed to truancy. Now, thats not reform, Mr. President. Why cant Landel Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzalez in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school? Some schools arent safe; some schools arent even safe. Your choice is nothing. Lets give them a real choice, the kind of choice you have and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America. If we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy, lets start with education. I had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the White House and other agencies who have never beenhad any experience, who came to Washington without any experience. Theyre all very liberal, of course, or they wouldnt be in the administration. And their idea was that they knew what was best for the American people. Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things. I feel strongly about education. I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of rights. And weve had millions of young men and women in subsequent wars change the face of the Nation because the Government helped with their education. Now, the reason they dont want to have you know, the reason the President cant support this is pretty obvious. Its not taking anything away from schools. Its new money. Its not going to be taken away from anybody else except it will downsize the Department of Education. But this is a very liberal administration. This is the administration that gave you the big tax cut. This is the administration that tried to take over health care and impose a governmental system. This is the administration that fought regulatory reform and thats putting a lot of smallbusiness men and small-business women out of business. This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice. And the list goes on and on and on. Thats what I had in mind. I want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand America. There wont be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the Cabinet. Theyll be people with experience and people who understand America and people who know the hard knocks in life. Well, I think its pretty liberal; Ill put that label on it. When you take a look at all the programs youve advocated, Mr. President, thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there. The first thing you did when you came into office was send up a stimulus package that said, weve got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion. And even some in your own party couldnt buy that. I remember talking by the telephoneIm not even certain you were too excited about itIll never repeat what I talked with the President about, but in any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion. And then came some other programs and then came health care and then came the tax increase. And a lot of these things just stopped in 1994 because then the Congress changed, and I think weve done a good job. Well, the President can define himself in any way he wants, but I think we have to look at the record. Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern. George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I dont meanbut he was a liberal, proud liberal. Ive just finished reading a book. I think its called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Radosh or something, talking about all the liberal influences in the administration, whether its organized labor or whether its the Hollywood elite or whether its some of the media elite or whether its the labor unions or whatever. And so I thinkyou take a look at it, but the bottom line is this: I think the American people probably lose sight of all of these bills and all these things. They want to know whats going to happen to them. Theyve all got a lot of anxieties out there. Did anybody complain when you raised taxes? Did anybody go out and ask the people, How are you going to pay the extra money? Thats why we want an economic package. We want the Government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies. Thats what our message is to people watching, not all this back and forthyou voted this way, you voted that way. We want a better America as we go into the next century. Let me say first on the Presidents promise for another tax cutI mean, Ive told people as I travel around, All of you who got the tax cut he promised last time, vote for him in 96, and not many hands go up. So the question is, would you buy a used election promise from my opponent? The people want economic reform. Theyre having a hard time making ends meet. You got one parent working for the Government, the other parent working for the family. And this is important business. This is about getting the economy moving again. This is about American jobs and opportunities. Its about the Government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer. When they raise your taxes, nobody runs around asking people, Where are you going to get the extra money? I think the Government can do better. Are there personal differences? Well, my blood pressure is lower and my weight, my cholesterol. But I will not make health an issue in this campaign. [Laughter] I think hes a bit taller than I am. But I think there are personal differences. I mean, I dont like to get into personal matters. As far as Im concerned, this is a campaign about issues. Its about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America, and not about personal things. And I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past. I know he wants to disown it. I wouldnt want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but youre stuck with it because thats your record. Its your record in Arkansas: the biggest tax increase in history, the biggest crime increase in history, biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas. Well, Im really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al DAmato, and I know he appreciates it. [Laughter] You didnt even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first 2 years you were President. It wasnt until we had a Republican Congress that you even thought aboutyou talked about tax cuts. And getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if youre a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight, and thats the question of pardons. I know you talked about it with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show. And Ive never discussed Whitewater, as Ive told you personally; Im not discussing Whitewater now. But I am discussing a power the President has to grant pardons, and hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest. But it seems to me the President shouldnt have any comment at all, particularly where its someone where youve had business dealings. I mean, you may be sending a signal; I dont know. Im not questioning anybody. But as the President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period. And I think he made a mistake, and I think when you make a mistake, you say, I made a mistake. But apparently his position hasnt changed. And so is Senator Kennedy a friend of yours I remember one day on the floor, I said, Now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories, and Kennedy jumped up and said, Why havent we thought of that before? [Laughter] One of your liberal friends. Whats the subject matter? [Laughter] See, if I say anything, its going to be misconstrued. I dont think this is even a race between the twoits about our vision for America. I happen to like President Clinton personally. Im addressing him all evening as Mr. President. I said in 1992 he didnt extend that courtesy to President Bush. But I respect the Presidency. Ive served under a number of Presidents; they all have their strengths, and they all have their weaknesses. So Id rather talk about my strengths. I think I have my strengths. I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word. Its a question between trust and fear. And I would say I think, Mr. President, about all youve got going in this campaign is fear. Youre spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads, frightening senior citizens. I know this to be a fact, because I had one tell me last week, Senator, dont cut my Medicare. Im trying to save your Medicare, just as I rescued Social Security with a bipartisan commission. I have relatives on Medicare. I used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents. I know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people, and thats been my career in the United States Senate. And Ill keep my word on the economic package. If I couldnt cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time, I wouldnt look you in the eye tonight in your living room, or wherever you may be, and say that this is good for America. People will tell you who have served with Bob Dole, agree or disagree, he kept his word. Thats what this race is all about. Well, Id say, you know, the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd bill, part of the Byrd-Dole billI cant remember who was in control then. I remember working with Senator Ribicoff from Connecticut on the hospice program; we now have 2,500 hospices. As I said, I remember, Ive worked all my life while I was in the CongressI left on June 11th because I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something. President Clinton ran for Governor in 1990 and said he was going to fill out his term, but he didnt. Hes President, so I guess its a little better deal. But I wanted the American people to know that I was willing to give up something; it wasnt just getting more power and more power. So I rolled the dice. I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line. We can give you all these numbers. They dont mean a thing if youre out of work, you have nothing to eat, or you cant have medical care, or youre holding a crack baby in your arms right now, and what do you do next? You know, Americas best days are ahead of us. Ive seen the tough times. I know they can be better. And Ill lead America to a brighter future. Well, there he goes again I mean, its a line that has been used before but exaggerating all of the things he did. He didnt do all these things. Lets take all of these 4, you know, years in a row. He came in with a high growth rate. The 1990 budget agreement, which some didnt like, had some very tough cost controls. It put a lot of pressure on Congress. The S&L crisis was over. They were starting to sell assets; all of that money was coming in. And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work. He talks about a smaller Government. There are actually more people in Government, except for the people in defense-related jobs. Theyre gone. The Government is bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says its not. In addition, the Republican Congress cut $53 billion. So lets give credit where credit is due. Governor Engler in Michigan cut taxes 21 times, created a lot of new jobs. So did Governor Thompson. So did Governor Rowland. And a lot of people out there deserve credit, Mr. President. When Im President of the United States, were going to have a Governors council, and were going to work directly with the Governors, Republicans and Democrats, to get power back to the people and back to the States. Are we done? Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank everyone for watching and listening. I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because theyre the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st century. Theyre the ones who have the challenges. And there are people out there making predictions that its not going to be the same; youre not going to have the opportunity; there is going to be more deficits, more drugs, more crime, and less confidence in the American people. And thats what youre faced with, what the parents are faced with and the grandparents are faced with. Its important. Its their future. And I would say to thoseI know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before. Drug use has gone up. And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just dont do it. And I know that I am someone older than you, but Ive had my anxious moments in my life. Ive learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress. Im standing here as proof that in America, the possibilities are unlimited. I know who I am, and I know where Im from, and I know where I want to take America. We are the greatest country on the face of the Earth. We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods than anywhere that I know of. This is important business. This election is important. I ask for your support. I ask for your help. If you really want to get involved, just tap into my home page, www.dolekemp96.org. Thank you. God bless America.\"\"\",\"\"\"This event is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It will last 90 minutes, following a format and rules worked out by the two campaigns. There will be 2-minute opening and closing statements; in between, a series of questions, each having three parts: a 90-second answer, a 60-second rebuttal, and a 30-second response. I will assist the candidates in adhering to those time limits, with the help of a series of lights visible to both. Under their rules, the candidates are not allowed to question each other directly. I will ask the questions. There are no limitations on the subjects. The order for everything tonight was determined by coin toss. Now to the opening statements and to President Clinton. Mr. President. Senator Dole, 2 minutes. Mr. President, first question: Theres a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal Government and that of Senator Dole. How would you define the difference? Senator Dole, one minute. Mr. President, 30 seconds. Senator Dole, the President said in his opening statement, we are better off today than we were 4 years ago. Do you agree? Mr. President, one minute. Senator Dole? Mr. President, Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform. Have you done so? Senator Dole. Mr. President. Senator Dole, speaking of your tax plan, do you still think thats a good idea, the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut? Mr. President. Senator Dole. Mr. President, the Senator mentioned trial lawyers, and that means campaign financing. How do you personally avoid being unduly influenced by people who give you money or give you services in your campaigns? Senator Dole? Mr. President. Well, Senator Dole, let me ask you the same question I asked the President: How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns? Mr. President. Senator Dole, 30 seconds. Mr. President, the Senator mentioned drugs. Hes suggested in the past that you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the United States. Is he right? Senator. Mr. President. Senator Dole, on the Governmentcontinuing to talk about the Governments roleif elected President, would you seek to repeal the Brady bill and the ban on assault weapons? Mr. President. Mr. President, Senator Dole said the other day that you practiced a photo-op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the United States throughout the world. Is he wrong about that? Senator. Mr. President. Senator Dole, if elected President, what criteria would you use to decide when to send U.S. troops into harms way? Senator Dole. Well, Mr. President, what is your attitude toward Cuba and how Cuba should be treated? Senator Dole, you mentioned health reform several times. What do you think should be done about the health care system? Senator. Senatorgo ahead and finish your sentence, sorry. Back to foreign affairs for a moment. Mr. President, are you satisfied with the way you handled this last Iraq crisis and the end result? Senator Dole. Senator Dole, on your photo-op foreign policy charge against the President No, no, I mean your charge against the President that he has a photo-op foreign policy; does the Middle East summit last week fall into that category? Senator Dole. Mr. President, in your acceptance speech in Chicago, you said the real choice in this race is, quote, whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past, about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us, about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where youre on your own. End quote. Are you saying that you believe Senator Dole is a man of the past and if elected President he would lead the country backward? Senator Dole. Mr. President. Senator Dole, do you still favor eliminating the Department of Education? Mr. President, whats wrong with the school choice proposal? Mr. President. Senator Dole, at the Republican Convention you said the following, and I quote: It is demeaning to the Nation that within the Clinton administration, a corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving schemes. End quote. Whom, precisely, and what, precisely, did you have in mind? Mr. President, if youre not a liberal, describe your political philosophy. Senator Dole, weve talked mostly now about differences between the two of you that relate to policy issues and that sort of thing. Are there also significant differences in the more personal area that are relevant to this election? That are relevant to this. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President, 30 seconds. Senator Dole, if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about President Clinton, on a policy matter or a personal matter, what would it be? Something to know about him, understand it, and appreciate it. Mr. President, what do you say to Senator Doles point that this election is about keeping ones word? Senator. All right, thats the last question, the last answer. Lets go now to the closing statements. Mr. President, youre first. Two minutes. Senator Dole, your closing statement, sir. \"\"\"\n",
      "October 19 1992,Governer Clinton,President Bush,\"\"\" No. There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more. But the truth is that middle class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who have been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years even though their incomes have gone down. The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less even though their incomes have gone up. I disagree with both of them. Let me just follow up here. I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy. His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today. As far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldnt. Just this year Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief. He vetoed middle class tax relief this year. Mr. Bushs Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first -- --President Bush. This year. -- -- fourth in manufacturing jobs; fourth in the reduction of poverty; fourth in income increase. Over the last 10 years weve created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average. Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average. We are second in tax burden, the second lowest tax burden in the country. We have the lowest per capita State and local spending in the country. Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a $4 billion budget in State and Federal funds is not all that small. I think the fact that I took a State that was one of the poorest States in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals, and hundreds of business executives are highly relevant. And the people who have jobs and educations and opportunities that didnt have them 10 years ago dont think its irrelevant at all. They think its highly relevant and wish the rest of the country -- -- You think its relevant. The only thing I would say about that is I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress. He really didnt have a new economic program until over 1,300 days into his Presidency and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now. I dont have any criticism of Mr. Perot. I think what Id like to talk about a minute is, since you asked him the question, was the General Motors issue. I dont think theres any question that the automobile executives made some errors in the 1980s, but I also think we should look at how much productivity has increased lately, how much labor has done to increase productivity, and how much management has done. Were still losing a lot of auto jobs, in my judgment, because we dont have a national economic strategy that would build the industrial base of this country. Lets just talk about the CAFE standards.Mr. Lehrer. All right. Thats the fuel efficiency standards. Theyre now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet. I never said, and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environment speech in April. I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon. I think that should be a goal. I never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved. The National Science Foundation did a study which said it would be difficult for us to reach fuel efficiency standards in excess of 37 miles per gallon by the year 2000. Id like to respond to that. You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico. Neither I nor anybody else, as far as I know, agreed to give him our proxy to say that whatever he did was fine for the workers of this country and for the interests of this country. Thats whats wrong with Mr. Bush. His whole deal is, youve got to be for it or against it, and you cant make it better. I believe we can be better. I think the American people are sick and tired of either-or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes. I think they want somebody with common sense, who can do whats best for the American people. Id be happy to discuss these other issues, but I cant believe he is accusing me of getting on both sides. I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim: Those 209 Americans last Thursday night in Richmond told us they wanted us to stop talking about each other and start talking about Americans and their problems and their promises. I think we ought to get back to that. Ill be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people.Mr. Lehrer. Mr. Perot? Boy, I had a great response to that. I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists. We ought to make them disclose the people theyve given money to when theyre testifying before congressional committees. We ought to close the lawyers loophole; they ought to have to disclose when theyre really lobbying. We ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interest. I agree with that. If I had to do it over again, I might answer the questions a little better. You know, I had been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role, and so I was asked a lot of questions about the things that happened a long time ago. I dont think I answered them as well as I could have. The mistake that was made was making the read my lips promise in the first place just to get elected, knowing what the size of the deficit was, knowing there was no plan to control health care costs, and knowing that we did not have a strategy to get real economic growth back into this economy. The choices were not good then. Well, I believe in the town hall meetings. They started with my campaign in New Hampshire. I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them. And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago. Ive done a lot of them, and Ill continue to do them as President. Susan, I dont agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign. There are many. But I think even more relevant is my record at home. For most of my time as Governor, a woman was my chief of staff, an African American was my chief cabinet officer, an African American was my chief economic development officer. Lets take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word. I mean, hes right, we dont have any evidence, at least, that our Government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait. And lets give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield. It was a remarkable event. Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks. And on December 19th, new regulations will go into effect which will, in effect, give the Government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble. I would just point out on the point Mr. Perot made, I agree that we need to cut spending in Congress. Ive called for a 25-percent reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures. But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent $1 billion less than President Bush asked them to spend. Now, when you outspend Congress, youre really swinging. You can read my plan. My plan says that we want to raise marginal incomes on family incomes above $200,000 from 31 to 36 percent; that we want to ask foreign corporations simply to pay the same percentage of taxes on their income that American corporations pay in America; that we want to use that money to provide over $100 billion in tax cuts for investment in new plant and equipment, for small business, for new technologies, and for middle class tax relief. You permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said to defend the honor of the country. What about the honor of my State? We rank first in the country in job growth. Weve got the lowest spending, State and local, in the country and the second lowest tax burden. The difference between Arkansas and the United States is that were going in the right direction, and this countrys going in the wrong direction. And I have to defend the honor of my State. I really cant believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after read my lips and 15 billion new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancing program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money and programs that he once opposed. But the main thing is he still didnt get it, from what he said the other night to that fine woman on our program, the 209 people in Richmond. They dont want us talking about each other. They want us to talk about the problems of this country. First Id like to thank the Commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible. I think the real winners of the debates were the American people. I was especially moved in Richmond a few days ago when 209 of our fellow citizens got to ask us questions. They went a long way toward reclaiming this election for the American people and taking their country back.\"\"\",\"\"\" Do I have one minute? Just the ground rules here. He doesnt like trickle-down Government, but hey, I think hes talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs. The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden. What I dont like is trickle-down Government. I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle-down, trickle-down, and hes still talking about spending more and taxing more. I think everybody is paying too much taxes. He refers to one tax increase. Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase. I didnt want to do it, and I went along with it. I said I made a mistake. If I make a mistake, I admit it. Thats quite different than some. But I think thats the American way. Well, the record in Arkansas. I mean, look at it. And thats what were asking America to have? Now, look, he says Arkansass a poor State. They are. But in almost every category, theyre lagging. Ill give you an example. I dont have a dog in this fight, but Id like to get in on it. Governor Clinton has to operate under a balanced budget amendment. He has to do it. That is the law. Id like to see a balanced budget amendment for America, to protect the American taxpayers. Then that would discipline not only the executive branch but the spending Congress, the Congress thats been in control of one party, his party, for 38 years. We almost had it done. And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyones yelling Clean House! One of the reasons is we almost had it done, and the Speaker, very able, decent fellow, I might add, but he twisted the arms of some of the sponsors of that legislation and had them change their vote. Jim, I dont think thats a fair shot. I hear it. I hear it echoed by political opponents, but I dont think its fair. I think weve been fighting from day one to do something about the inner cities. Im for enterprise zones. I have had it in every single proposal Ive sent to the Congress. Now we hear a lot of talk, Oh, well, we all want enterprise zones. Yet the House and the Senate cant send it down without loading it up with a lot of these Christmas tree ornaments they put on the legislation. I dont think thats true at all. I dont think thats true. But, you know, let others fire away on it. Well, I think youre overlooking that we have had major accomplishments in the first term. But if youre talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the United States Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress. You dont have to go back to Herbert Hoover. Go back to Jimmy Carter. Interest rates were 21 percent. Inflation was 15 percent. The misery index, unemployment, inflation added together, it was invented by the Democrats, went right through the roof. Weve cut it in half, and all you hear about is how bad things are. Well, I wondered when Governor Clinton was talking to the autoworkers whether he talked about his and Senator Gores favoring CAFE standards, those are fuel efficiency standards, of 40 miles per gallon. That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work. Well, Im caught in the middle of NAFTA. Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American free trade agreement. I am for the North American free trade agreement. My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time hes going to make up his mind, he will see some merit in it. But then he sees a lot of things wrong with it. And then the other day, he says hes for it; however, then weve got to pass other legislation. When youre President of the United States, you cannot have this pattern of saying, Well, Im for it, but Im on the other side of it. And its true on this, and its true on CAFE. I think he made my case. On the one hand, its a good deal, but on the other hand, Id make it better. You cant do that as President. You cant do it on the war, where he says, Well, I was with the minority, but I guess I would have voted with the majority. Ive always said trickle-down Government is bad. Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress. I dont think theres anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case. Thats the American way. What youre assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyists themselves corrupt. I dont agree with that. Well, I think youve got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists. The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard. If the laws are violated so much -- but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I dont agree with it. I promise its less than 10 seconds.Mr. Lehrer. Okay. I heard Governor Clinton congratulate us on one thing. First time he said something pleasant about this administration. Productivity in this country is up. It is way up. Productivity is up, and thats a good thing. There are many other good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that. Well, Ive expressed my heartfelt difference with Governor Clinton on organizing demonstrations while in a foreign land against your country when young ghetto kids have been drafted and are dying. I wouldnt have taken any of the alternatives. I believe I made a mistake. I did it for the very reasons you say. There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending. One-third of the Presidents budget is at the Presidents discretion, or really, the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell the President how to spend every dime. Weve put a cap on the growth of all that spending, and thats good. And thats helped. But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with one Democratic tax increase, would help the economy. I see no evidence that it has done it. Hey, youve got something there. I would like the record to show the panelists that Ross Perot took the first shot at the press. My favorite bumper sticker, though, is Annoy the Media. Reelect President   [Laughter] I just had to work that in. Sorry, Helen. Im going to pay for this later on. You dont see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today? I happen to think shes a key person. I think our Cabinet members are key people. I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer. Look at our Cabinet. You talk about somebody strong, look at Carla Hills. Look at Lynn Martin, whos fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it. Look at our Surgeon General, Dr. Novello. You can look all around and youll see first-class, strong women. Id like to reply on that. That gets to the national honor. We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, You can take the northern part of Kuwait. That is absolutely absurd. Glaspie has testified -- -- -- -- and Glaspies papers have been presented to the United States Senate. So please -- -- I apologize. When I make a mistake, I say -- [laughter]. No, I dont. I apologize for it. But that one got right to the national honor.Mr. Lehrer. All right. Okay.President Bush. And Im sorry. Its awful easy when youre dealing with 90/90 hindsight. We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations. He did have the fourth largest army. All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that. When he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said, This aggression will not stand. We formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down. We destroyed the fourth largest army, and the battlefield was searched, and there wasnt one single iota of evidence that any U.S. weapons were on that battlefield. The nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasnt been one single scintilla of evidence that theres any U.S. technology involved in it. Well, I dont believe it would be appropriate for a President to suggest that the banking system is not sound; it is sound. There are some problem banks out there. But what we need is financial reform. We need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation. I have proposed that, and when I am reelected I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress, not beholden to the old ways, to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesnt put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound. I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Association, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound. Certainly theres no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view. How about this for a Government reform policy? Reduce the White House staff by a third after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff; term limits for Members of the United States Congress. Give the Government back to the people. Lets do it that way. The President has term limits. Lets limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight. Term limits, and then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution? Forty-three States, more than that, States have it, I believe. Lets try that. Thats what worries me, that hes going to be responsible. He would do for the United States what he has done for Arkansas. He would do for the United States what hes done to Arkansas. We do not want to be the lowest of the low. We are not a nation in decline. We are a rising nation. My problem is, I heard what he said. He said, I want to take it from the rich, raise $150 billion from the rich. To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, youve got to go down to the guy thats making $36,600. And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, youre going to sock it to the working man. Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums. Why Ill win is I think I have the best plan of the three of us up here to do something about it. Mine does not grow the Government. It does not have Government invest. It says we need to do better in terms of stimulating private business. Weve got a big philosophical difference here tonight between one who thinks the Government can do all these things through tax and spend, and one who thinks it ought to go the other way. Thats why I think Ill win. Three weeks from now -- two weeks from tomorrow, America goes to the polls. Youre going to have to decide who you want to lead this country to economic recovery. On jobs, thats the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brandnew approach to education, strengthening the American family, and yes, creating more exports is the way to go. I dont believe in trickle-down Government. I dont believe in larger taxes and larger Government spending.\"\"\",\"\"\" Mr. President, a response. Well, you have roughly one minute. We can loosen that up a little bit. But go ahead. Mr. Perot, what do you think of the Governors approach, what he just laid out? Governor, the word pain, one of the other leadership things thats put on you is that you dont speak of pain, that you speak of all things -- nobodys going to really have to suffer under your plan. Youve heard what Mr. Perot has said. He said to do the things you want to do, you cant do it by just taking the money from the rich. Thats what the President says as well. How do you respond to that? The numbers dont add up. As a practical matter, Mr. President, do you agree with the Governor when he says that the middle class -- the taxes on the middle class -- do your numbers agree that the taxes on the middle class have gone up during the last -- -- Mr. President, when you said just then that you admit your mistakes, and you looked at Governor Clinton and said -- what mistake is it that you want him to admit to? Governor, is that true? Mr. Perot, if you were sitting at home now and just heard this exchange about Arkansas, who would you believe? Why is that a mistake?Mr. Perot. Its irrelevant. [Laughter] What he did as Governor of Arkansas -- -- Mr. President, lets move to some of the leadership concerns that have been voiced about you. They relate to something you said in your closing statement in Richmond the other night about the President being the manager of crises, and that relates to an earlier criticism that you began to focus on the economy, on health care, on racial divisions in this country only after they became crises. Is that a fair criticism? Well, its just that -- youve spoken to it, I mean, but the idea -- not so much in specifics -- --President Bush. Yes. -- -- but that it has to be a crisis before it gets your attention. Do you think thats true, Mr. Perot? You dont think this is an issue? Well, then, Ill phrase it differently then. He said the other night in his closing words in Richmond that one of the key things that he believes the American people should decide among the three of you, is who they want in charge if this country gets to a crisis. Now, thats what he said. And the rap on the President is that its only crisis time that he focuses on some of these things. So my question to you -- were going to talk about you in a minute. No, no, no. No, no. But my question to you is -- so, if you have nothing to say about it, fine. Ill go to Governor Clinton. But -- -- We have to talk about Ross Perot now, or hell get me, Im sure. Governor, do you have a response to the staying the course question about Mr. Perot? Mr. President, do you have a response?President Bush. To this?Mr. Lehrer. Yes. Governor, what about that charge that you want it both ways on this issue? Mr. Perot, based on your experience at General Motors, where do you come down on this? This has been thrown about, back and forth during this campaign from the very beginning about jobs and CAFE standards. Just for the record, though, Mr. Perot, I take it then for your answer you do not have a position on whether or not enforcing the CAFE standards will cost jobs in the auto industry. So that means no -- [laughter] -- in other words, you agree with President Bush, is that right? I wanted -- yes, sir. Governor, a quick answer on trade, and I want to go on to something else. No. Mr. Perot, youre doing fine. Go ahead. Whatever you want to say, say it.Foreign Lobbyists Wait a minute. I was going to ask -- I thought you wanted to respond to what we were talking about. Mr. President, how do you respond to that? Mr. Perot has made that charge several times, the fact that you have people working in your campaign who are paid foreign lobbyists. Governor, Im sorry, but that concludes my time with -- -- All right. Go ahead, quickly. Just very briefly. Im going to be in real trouble if I dont bring out -- its about time -- -- All right. Now were going to bring in three other journalists to ask questions. They are Susan Rook of CNN, Gene Gibbons of Reuters, and Helen Thomas of United Press International. Okay, we are going to continue on the subject of leadership, and the first question goes to Governor Clinton for a 2-minute answer. It will be asked by Helen Thomas. Helen?The Draft Issue A reminder now, were back on the St. Louis rules, which means that the Governor had his answer, and then each of you will have one minute to respond.Mr. President. Your minute is up, sir.Mr. Perot, one minute. All right. The next question goes to President Bush, and Gene Gibbons will ask it.1990 Budget Agreement Mr. Perot, one minute. Ill take responsibility for saying your time is up. All right, Mr. Perot, the question is for you. You have a 2-minute answer, and it will be asked by Susan Rook.Leadership Governor Clinton, one minute. President Bush, one minute. All right, were going to go on to another subject now, and the subject is priorities. And the first question goes to you, President Bush, and Susan will ask it.Women Advisers Mr. Perot, one minute. Mr. President, when you -- just make sure that everybody knows whats going on here. When you responded directly to Mr. Perot then -- --President Bush. Yes. -- -- you violated the rule, your rules. Now, Im willing -- -- No, no, no. I just want to make sure that everybody understands. If you all want to change the rules, we can do it. Okay. But Governor Clinton, you have a minute.Women Advisers All right. The next question goes to you, Mr. Perot, for 2 minutes. Its a 2-minute question, and Helen will ask it. Helen?Investigations Governor Clinton, you have one minute. Mr. President, you have a moment -- a minute, Im sorry. The next question goes to Governor Clinton, and Gene Gibbons will ask it. Gene?Banking Situation President Bush, one minute. Mr. Perot, one minute. All right, Mr. Perot. The next question, were going into a new round here on a category just called differences. And the question goes to you, Mr. Perot, and Gene will ask it. Gene?Government Reform Governor Clinton, you have one minute. Governor. President Bush, one minute.President Bush. On Government reform?Mr. Lehrer. Sir?President Bush. Government reform? Yes. Well, to respond to the subject that Mr. Perot mentioned. The next question goes to Governor Clinton. You have two minutes, Governor, and Susan will ask it.Taxes President Bush, you have one minute. Weve got a wash, according to my calculations. We have a wash. And well go to Mr. Perot for one minute. In other words, the violation of the rule; thats what I meant. Thats right, youre clean. [Laughter] This is the last question, and it goes to President Bush for a 2-minute answer. And it will be asked by Helen.Presidential Campaign Mr. Perot, you have one minute. Mr. Perot, you have -- sorry. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Perot, you have one minute. No. Governor Clinton has a minute after you. Then we have the closing statements. Governor Clinton, one minute. All right. That was the final question and answer, and we now go to the closing statements. Each candidate will have up to 2 minutes. The order was determined by a drawing. Governor Clinton, you are first. Governor.Closing Statements President Bush, your closing statement, sir. Mr. Perot, your closing statement, sir. Thank you, Mr. Perot. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Governor Clinton, for being with us tonight and the previous debates. Thank you to the panel.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 15 1992,Governer Clinton,President Bush,\"\"\" Id like to answer the question, because Ive actually been a Governor for 12 years, so Ive known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports. No, and heres why; Ill tell you exactly why, because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years. Ill tell you exactly what I think can be done. I think we can bring it down by 50 percent in 4 years and grow the economy. Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight. I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire, and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions, and I tried to give very specific answers. I also had a program starting last year. Wait a minute. Lets dont -- you dont have to believe that. Heres my point. Im not interested in his character. I want to change the character of the Presidency. And Im interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years. So I think youre right, and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you. I agree with him.Ms. Simpson. President Bush? Ross had his hand up. Wait a minute. I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness. The ideas I express are mine. Ive worked on these things for 12 years, and Im the only person up here who hasnt been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years. So I dont want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else. I worked 12 years very hard as a Governor on the real problems of real people. Im just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day. I never thought Id ever be involved in anything like this.Mr. Perot. May I finish? That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more, and thats why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year. This is not mud slinging. This is fact slinging.President Bush. There you go. A bill earlier this year -- this is fact -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities and our country. But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more. Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing. I agree with him. I mean, we agree with that. I support the right to keep and bear arms. I live in a State where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses or both. But I believe we have to have some way of checking handguns before theyre sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them. Therefore, I support the Brady bill, which would impose a national waiting period, unless and until a State did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records. Once you automate your records, then you dont have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check. I know theyre popular, but Im against them. Ill tell you why. I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller States in the Congress who would have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard. Number two, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already. I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think youre going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected who have lots of expertise. Ive had more people talk to me about their health care problems, I guess, than anything else. All across America, people who have lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children -- so let me try to answer you in this way. One brief point. We have elections so people can make decisions about this. The point I want to make to you is, a bipartisan commission reviewed my plan and the Bush plan and concluded -- there were as many Republicans as Democratic health care experts on it -- they concluded that my plan would cover everybody, and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000, and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy. The average family would save $1,200 a year under the plan that I offered, without any erosion in the quality of health care. So I ask you to look at that. Tell me how its affected you again? You know people who have lost their jobs and lost their homes?Q. Yes. Well, Ive been Governor of a small State for 12 years. Ill tell you how its affected me. Every year, Congress and the President sign laws that make us do more things; it gives us less money to do it with. I see people in my State, middle class people, their taxes have gone up from Washington and their services have gone down, while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts. I think I remember the question. [Laughter] Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question, but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy. What you have to decide is whos got the best economic plan. We all have ideas out there, and Mr. Bush has a record. I dont want you to read my lips, and I sure dont want you to read his. [Laughter] I do hope you will read our plans.Now, specifically -- -- -- -- one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it; there are different ideas. The Bush plan, the Perot plan, the Clinton -- we have different ideas. I am convinced, having studied health care for a year, hard, and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the costs of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets. Youve got to do that. Weve got to get those costs down. Id rather answer her question first, and then Ill be glad to, because the question you ask is important. The end of the cold war brings an incredible opportunity for change, the winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing. It also requires us to maintain some continuity, some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles. First of all, let me say that Ive spent more of my time in life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue. Seventy percent of my States money goes to public schools. I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other State in the country except one other. They named two States showing real strides forward in the eighties. So I care a lot about this, and Ive spent countless hours in schools. In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget. In 6 years, the college program would cost $8 billion over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4. You pay $3 billion for busted loans, because we dont have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees. So the net cost will be $8 billion 6 years from now, in a trillion-plus budget: not very much. I just want to mention if I could -- --Ms. Simpson. Very briefly. Very briefly. Involving the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if theyre poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference. We have a big program in my State that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school. Its the most successful thing weve ever done. Well, I dont have any idea, but I hope it will happen sometime in my lifetime.Q. I do, too. I believe that this country is electing more and more African-Americans and Latinos and Asian-Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race. The American people are beginning to vote across racial lines, and I hope it will happen more and more. Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentleman. Since I suggested this format, I hope its been good for all of you. Ive really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly. I thought I owed that to you. And I respect you for being here, and for the impact youve had on making this a more positive experience.\"\"\",\"\"\" Well, Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what Im trying to do is increase our exports. If, indeed, all the jobs were going to move south because of lower wages, there are lower wages now, and they havent done that. So I have just negotiated with the President of Mexico the North American free trade agreement, and the Prime Minister of Canada, I might add. I want to have more of these free trade agreements because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas. Thats a scare tactic, because its not that many. But any one thats here, we want to have more jobs here, and the way to do that is to increase our exports. Well, Ive got to -- Im a little confused here because I dont see how you can grow the deficit down by raising peoples taxes. You see, I dont think the American people are taxed too little. I think theyre taxed too much. I went for one tax increase, and when I make a mistake, I admit it, say that wasnt the right thing to do. Governor Clintons program wants to tax more and spend more: $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220 billion. I dont believe thats the way to do it. Well, first place, I believe that character is a part of being President. I think you have to look at it. I think that has to be a part of candidate for President or being President. In terms of programs, Ive submitted, what, four different budgets to the United States Congress in great detail. Theyre so heavy theyd give you a broken back. Everything in there says what I am for. Now, Ive come out with a new agenda for Americas renewal, a plan that I believe really will help stimulate the growth of this economy. Excuse me, I dont want to -- no, go ahead, Carole.Ms. Simpson. Governor Clinton. I get wound up because I feel strongly. Please dont say anything by the Washington Post. Lets do it. Lets talk about programs for children. I think it depends on how you define it. I mean, I think, in general, lets talk about these issues, lets talk about the programs. But in the Presidency, a lot goes into it. Caring goes into it; thats not particularly specific. Strength goes into it; thats not specific. Standing up against aggression; thats not specific in terms of a program. This is what a President has to do. Id be glad to take a shot at it.Ms. Simpson. Please. Im not sure that -- and I can understand if you havent seen this because theres been a lot of hue and cry. We passed this year the most farthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways, $150 billion for improving the infrastructure. That happened when I was President. So I am very proud of the way that came about, and I think its a very, very good beginning. Sure, but the problem is you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good. Thats the problem with our system. If you had a line-item veto, you could knock out the pork. You could knock out the tax increases, and you could do what the people want, and that is create enterprise zones. I think you put your finger on a major problem. I talk about strengthening the American family. Its very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and send their kid down to get a loaf of bread. Its very hard. I have been fighting for very strong anticrime legislation: habeas corpus reform, so you dont have these endless appeals; so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real. Ive been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule, so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesnt go away. Ill probably get into a fight in this room with some, but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers. Any order? Ill be glad to respond. I strongly support term limits for Members of the United States Congress. I believe it would return the Government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about. The Presidents terms are limited to two, a total of 8 years. Whats wrong with limiting the terms of Members of Congress to 12? Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized. For 38 years, one party has controlled the House of Representatives. And the result? A sorry little post office that cant do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all of Chase Bank and Citibank put together. I just have to say something. I dont want to stampede -- Ross was very articulate. Across the country, I dont want anybody to stampede to cut the Presidents salary off altogether. Barbara is sitting over here, and I -- [laughter] -- but what I have proposed, 10 percent cut, downsize the Government, and we can get that done. Well, I think the national debt affects everybody. Obviously, it has a lot to do with interest rates -- -- Well, Im sure it has. I love my grandchildren. I want to think that -- --Q. How? I want to think that theyre going to be able to afford an education. I think that thats an important part of being a parent. If the question -- maybe I get it wrong. Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesnt affect them? Im not sure I get it. Help me with the question, and Ill try to answer it. Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time. Well, the Social Security -- youre an expert and I could, Im sure, learn from you the details of the pension guaranty fund and the Social Security fund. The Social Security system was fixed, about 5 years, and I think its projected out to be sound beyond that. So at least we have time to work with it. [Inaudible] -- first rule? We have come to that position. Since I became President, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic. No longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule. This is exciting. This new world order to me means freedom and democracy. Id be delighted to, because you cant do it the old way. You cant do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything. And thats why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about. Its being worked now in 1,700 communities -- I bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1,700 communities across the country. Its called America 2000. It literally says to the communities: Reinvent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else. Think anew. We have a concept called the New American School Corporation, where were doing exactly that. I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said. My school choice program, GI bill for kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools. It does what the GI bill itself did when I came out of World War II. It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want. Where its been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that werent chosen find that they then compete and do better. So I think its worth a shot. I think if Barbara Bush were running this year shed be elected. [Laughter] But its too late. You werent impressed with the fact that he performed -- -- Yes, but wouldnt that suggest to the American people then heres a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically -- -- -- -- get the nomination of either party? Huh? Oh, I see. You mean time?Q. Yeah. I dont know. Starting after 4 years. [Laughter] No, I think youll see -- --Ms. Simpson. Mr. Perot? I think youll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.Ms. Simpson. Thank you. This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate. Lets see how they do. I hope a lot of them lose. How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?Mr. Perot. Absolutely.President Bush. Yeah, good man.Mr. Perot. Absolutely. My candidates right back there. May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson a -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause. [Applause] Just dont take it out of my time.Ms. Simpson. Thats right. I feel strongly about it, but I dont want it to come out of my time.Ms. Simpson. Thats right. [Laughter] No, but let me just say to the American people: In 2 1/2 weeks, were going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down. Three ways to do that: one is to raise taxes; one is to reduce spending, controlling that mandatory spending; another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth.\"\"\",\"\"\" And I think the first question is over here.Foreign Trade and Domestic Jobs Thank you, Mr. Perot. I see that the President has stood up, so he must have something to say about this. Thank you. I think we have a question over here.Federal Deficit How about you, Mr. Perot? Youre all wonderful speakers, and I know you have lots more to add. But I have talked to this audience, and they have lots of questions on other topics. Can we move to another topic, please? Who wants to take that one? Mr. Perot, you have an answer for everything, dont you? Go right ahead, sir. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. Perot. So that seems directed. He would say its you gentlemen that have been doing that. Mr. Clinton, Governor Clinton, how do you -- President Bush, how would you like to respond? Mr. President, I am getting time cues, and with all due respect, Im sorry. Yes, you do. [Laughter] May I -- I talked to this audience before you gentlemen came, and I asked them about how they felt about the tenor of the campaign. Would you like to let them know what you thought about that, when I said, Are you pleased with how the campaigns been going?Audience members. No! Who wants to say why you dont like the way the campaign is going? We have a gentleman back here?Focusing on Issues So your question is -- -- How do you respond? How do you gentlemen respond to -- -- Yes, you may finish.Mr. Perot. Very briefly?Ms. Simpson. Yes, very briefly. Thank you. We have a question here.Domestic Infrastructure The cities. Who is going to fix the cities, and how? Mr. President, arent you threatening to veto the bill, the urban aid bill, that included enterprise zones? Governor Clinton, youre chomping at the bit. Mr. Perot, what about your plans for the cities? You want to tackle the economy and the deficit first. Mr. Perot, everybody thought you won the first debate because you were plain-speaking, and you make it sound, oh, so simple. Well just do it. What makes you think that youre going to be able to get the Democrats and Republicans together any better than these guys? Are you answering my question? [Laughter] No, I want you to tell me how youre going to be able to get the Republicans and Democrats in Congress -- --Mr. Perot. Oh, Im sorry. -- -- to work together better than these two gentlemen. Okay. I have a question here.Gun Control and Crime Mr. Perot, there are young black males in America dying at unprecedented -- -- Yes, Im getting -- -- -- -- to the fact that homicide is the leading cause of death among young black males, 15 to 24 years old. What are you going to do to get the guns off the street? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Perot. Mr. Perot, would you like to address term limitations? Thank you very much. Thank you. Sorry to cut you short, but, President Bush, health care reform. Brief, Governor Clinton. Thank you. Well, Mr. Perot, yes, of course. Thank you, Mr. Perot.Mr. President. Shes saying you personally. Has it affected you personally? I think she means more the recession, the economic problems today the country faces rather than -- -- Thank you, Governor Clinton. We are a little more than halfway through this program, and Im glad that were getting the diversity of questions that we are. President Bush, may we start with you? Mr. Perot, can you wrap it up? But weve got to be fair. Mr. Perot, Im sorry, Im going to -- --Mr. Perot. Sorry. And I dont want to sound-bite you, but we are trying to be fair to everyone. All right, Governor Clinton. Thank you. I think we have a question here on international affairs, hopefully.Foreign Affairs Governor Clinton, the President mentioned Saddam Hussein. Your vice president and you have had some words about the President and Saddam Hussein. Would you care to comment? Okay, we have a question up there.Education Who would like to begin? The education President? Thank you, Governor Clinton. What the question is -- what is it going to cost? What is it going to cost? Mr. Perot, you on education, please. No, you dont. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. Perot. Thank you. President Bush, you wanted to add something. We have very little time left, and it occurs to me that we have talked all this time and there has not been one question about some of the racial tensions and ethnic tensions in America. Is there anyone in this audience that would like to pose a question to the candidates on this? Yes?Women or Minority Presidential Candidates Governor Clinton, why dont you answer that first. Okay. Im sorry we have just a little bit of time left. Lets try to get responses from each of them.President Bush or Mr. Perot? Mr. Perot, I dont want to cut you up any more, but we only have a minute left. How about a woman? What about a woman?Mr. Perot. Oh, oh. Thank you. I want to apologize to our audience because there were 209 people here, and there were 209 questions. We only got to a fraction of them, and Im sorry to those of you that didnt get to ask your questions, but we must move to the conclusion of the program. Thank you, Mr. President. And now a closing statement from Mr. Perot. Im sorry, Mr. Perot. Once again -- -- And finally, last but not least, Governor Clinton. Thank you, Governor Clinton.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 11 1992,Governer Clinton,President Bush,\"\"\" The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change: a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax-and-spend economics, to invest and grow. But before I can do that I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide. I believe experience counts, but its not everything. Values, judgment, and the record that I have amassed in my State also should count for something. Ive worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people. My State now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in the reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine. Thats because we believe in investing in education and in jobs. Ross gave a good answer, but Ive got to respond directly to Mr. Bush. You have questioned my patriotism. You even brought some rightwing Congressmen into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969 - 1970, when over 50,000 other Americans did. The tax increase I have proposed triggers in at family incomes of $200,000 and above. Those are the people who, in the 1980s, had their incomes go up while their taxes went down. Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of six increases in the payroll taxes. So that is where my income limit would trigger. My plan, notwithstanding my opponents ad, my plan triggers in at gross incomes, family incomes of $200,000 and above. And then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle-class people with families with incomes of under $60,000. I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made. I disagree that we need 150,000 troops to fulfill our role in Europe. We certainly must maintain an engagement there. There are certainly dangers there. There are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to Europe than to the United States. But two former Defense Secretaries recently issued reports saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagans former Defense Secretary, Mr. Carlucci. Many of the military experts whom I consulted on this agreed. I think Mr. Perot has confronted this deficit issue, but I think its important to point out that we really have two deficits in America, not one. We have a budget deficit in the Federal Government, but we also have an investment, a jobs, an income deficit. We must have a transition plan, a plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy. No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that. There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home. That is what I want to do. This country desperately needs a jobs program. And my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated. I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected Members of the Congress, and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration. And we would present a jobs program. Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms and the way it works. But frankly, I dont think thats the problem today. We have low interest rates today. At least we have low interest rates that the Fed can control. Our long-term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance. In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change. There are three fundamental challenges. First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place. We need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of the post-cold-war era; a smaller permanent military force, but one that is more mobile, well-trained, with high-technology equipment. We need to continue the negotiations to reduce nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States. We need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I think our relation-ships with China are important, and I dont think we want to isolate China. But I think it is a mistake for us to do what this administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square, and Mr. Bush sent two people in secret to toast the Chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it. They rewarded him by opening negotiations with Iran to transfer nuclear technology. That was their response to that sort of action. I agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of Bosnia or in the tribal wars of Somalia. But I think that its important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that and that we do have interests there. There are, after all, two million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter. A family involves at least one parent, whether natural or adoptive or foster, and children. A good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted from the elders to the children, a place where people turn for refuge and where they know theyre the most important people in the world. Like Mr. Perot, I have held crack babies in my arms. But I know more about this, I think, than anybody else up here because I have a brother whos a recovering drug addict. Im very proud of him. But I can tell you this: If drugs were legal, I dont think hed be alive today. I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs. He is alive today because of the criminal justice system. I grew up in the segregated south, thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of God. I saw the winds of hatred divide people and keep the people of my State poorer than they would have been, spiritually and economically. Ive done everything I could in my public life to overcome racial divisions. We dont have a person to waste in this country. Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS. Well over a million and a quarter Americans are HIV-positive. We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it. We need to accelerate the drug approval process. We need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy, Ryan White, to make sure were doing everything we can on research and treatment. The President should lead a national effort to change behavior to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive. This is a matter of life and death. Ross, thats a great speech, but its not quite that simple. [Laughter] I mean, look at the facts. Both parties in Washington, the President and the Congress, have cut Medicare. The average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965 before Medicare came in. The Presidents got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years. Mr. Bush made that charge. I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something. Id like to thank the people of St. Louis and Washington University, the Presidential Debate Commission, and all those who made this night possible. And Id like to thank those of you who are watching. Most of all, Id like to thank all of you who have touched me in some way over this last year, all the thousands of you whom Ive seen. Id like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in Silicon Valley, two-thirds of whom are Republicans, who said they wanted to sign on to a change to create a new America. Id like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to Chicago, a third of them Republicans, who said they wanted a change. Id like to thank the people who started with Mr. Perot who have come on to help our campaign. Id like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about: the woman who was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time; and the people who are winning, but who know how desperately we need to change.\"\"\",\"\"\" Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience. I think weve dramatically changed the world. Ill talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace. Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war. And change for changes sake isnt enough. We saw that message in the late seventies when we heard a lot about change. And what happened? That misery index went right through the roof. I just thought of another, another big difference here between me -- I dont believe Mr. Perot feels this way, but I know Governor Clinton did, because I want to accurately quote him. He thinks, I think he said, that the country is coming apart at the seams. Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy is worse than it is. But this countrys not coming apart at the seams, for heaven sakes. Were the United States of America. In spite of the economic problems, we are the most respected economy around the world. Many would trade for it. Weve been caught up in a global slowdown. We can do much, much better. But we ought not to try to convince the American people that America is a country thats coming apart at the seams. I think the American people should be the judge of that. I think character is a very important question. I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- put it this way -- I think its wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil. I just think its wrong. Maybe, they say, well, it was a youthful indiscretion. I was 19 or 20, flying off an aircraft carrier, and that shaped me to be Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. And Im sorry, but demonstrating -- its not a question of patriotism. Its a question of character and judgment. I have to correct one thing. I didnt question the mans patriotism; I questioned his judgment and his character. What he did in Moscow, thats fine. Let him explain it. He did. I accept that. What I dont accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your countrys at war. Im sorry, I cannot accept that. Well, Sander, thats a good question. And the answer is: For 40-some years, we kept the peace. If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant. We have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed. I have cut defense spending. And the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the cold war. We never would have got there if wed gone for the nuclear-freeze crowd; never would have got there if wed listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending. I think it is important that the United States stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace. We simply cannot pull back. The question was on fairness. I just disagree with Mr. Perot. I dont believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances. I dont think we need to do it. Well, I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas. I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes. I think its a good decision. I took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do. And weve worked it out, and indeed, were moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way. So that one we came away with which -- in creating jobs for the American people. Well, weve got a plan announced for what we can do for small business. Ive already put forward things that will get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight: investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, a tax credit for first-time homebuyers. I dont think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch. There is separation there. I think thats fine. Alan Greenspan is respected. Ive had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered rates. We still are the envy of the world in terms of our military; theres no question about that. Were the envy of the world in terms of our economy, in spite of the difficulties were having; theres no question about that. Our exports are dramatically up. Well, the administration was the first major country to stand up against the abuse in Tiananmen Square. We are the ones that worked out the prison labor deal. We are the ones that have lowered the barrier to products, the Carla Hills negotiation. I am the one that said, lets keep the MFN because you see China moving toward a free market economy. To do what the Congress and Governor Clinton are suggesting, you would isolate and ruin Hong Kong. They are making some progress, not enough for us. We were the first ones to put sanctions on. We still have them on some things. -- -- you must make the very changes theyre making now. Ann, both of them are very complicated situations. I vowed something, because I learned something from Vietnam: I am not going to commit U.S. forces until I know what the mission is, until the military tell me that it can be completed, until I know how they can come out. Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the Mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family. So I do think we need to strengthen family. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby, shes showing a certain compassion for family. When she reads to children, the same thing. We could use one. No. I dont think thats the right answer. I dont believe legalizing narcotics is the answer. I just dont believe thats the answer. I do believe that theres some fairly good news out there. The use of cocaine, for example, by teenagers is dramatically down. But weve got to keep fighting on this war against drugs. Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed. I do think its fair to note -- he can rebut it -- that Arkansas is one of the few States that doesnt have any civil rights legislation. Coming from the political process. We have increased funding for AIDS. Weve doubled it, on research and on every other aspect of it. My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS, 10 times as much for AIDS victim as per cancer victim. I think that were showing the proper compassion and concern. So I cant tell you where its coming from, but I am very much concerned about AIDS, and I believe that weve got the best researchers in the world out there at NIH working the problem. Were funding them. I wish there was more money, but were funding them far more than any time in the past. Were going to keep on doing that. Well, first place Id like to clear up something, because every 4 years the Democrats go around and say, Hey, Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare. Theyve started it again. I am the President that stood up and said, Dont mess with Social Security. And Im not going to, and we havent. We are not going to go after the Social Security recipient. I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I dont think we need to touch Social Security. Well, I dont have time in 30 seconds or one minute to talk about our health care reform plan. The Oregon plan made some good sense, but its easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled. As President, I have to be sure that those waivers which were approving all over the place are covered under the law. Maybe we can work it out. But the Americans for Disabilities Act, speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation, was the foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times. So we do have something more than a technical problem. Well, let me tell you a little what its like to be President. In the Oval Office, you cant predict what kind of crisis is going to come up. You have to make tough calls. You cant be on one hand this way and one hand another. You cant take different positions on these difficult issues.\"\"\",\"\"\" Governor Clinton, one-minute response.

      "October 13 1988,MR. DUKAKIS,MR. BUSH,\"\"\" No, I dont, Bernard. And I think you know that Ive opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I dont see any evidence that its a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime. Weve done so in my own state. And its one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America; why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America. But we have work to do in this nation. We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs. And thats something I want to lead, something we havent had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war. We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere. And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war. But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home. And thats one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States. Weve had great success in my own state. And weve reached out to young people and their families and been able to help them by beginning drug education and prevention in the early elementary grades. So we can fight this war, and we can win this war. And we can do so in a way that marshals our forces, that provides real support for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been getting that support, and do it in a way which will bring down violence in this nation, will help our youngsters to stay away from drugs, will stop this avalanche of drugs thats pouring into the country, and will make it possible for our kids and our families to grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods. Bernard, this was the first presidential decision that we as nominees were called upon to make. And thats why people are so concerned. Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate. More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make. The Vice President talks about national security. Three times since World War II, the Vice President has had to suddenly become the President and commander in chief. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job. (Applause) GOY. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle, and before he did it, he said, watch my choice for vice president, it will tell all And it sure did. It sure did. (Applause) Ann, the Vice President made that pledge. Hes broken it three times in the past year already. So it isnt worth the paper its printed on. And what Im concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around. He says hes not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly. He says he wants to give the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country a five-year $40 billion tax break, and were going to pay for it. And hes been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions. Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt thats already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then Im worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around. No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who wont blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spendingSHAW: Governor will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States. (Applause)SHAW: And to Governor Dukakis. No, Im not sure I can promise that; I dont think either one of us can really. There is no way of anticipating what may happen. I will say this I dont know if the vice president agrees with that. Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didnt raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didnt do that. As a matter of fact, Im the first governor in the history of my state to fund that pension system, and Im very proud of that. (Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; Ive won a lot of elections, Ive lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses. I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests. I think Im a reasonably likable guy. (Laughter, scattered applause) Im serious though I think Im a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature. But Im also a serious guy. I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way. So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November. (Laughter) But I also think its important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices. Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president Well, Margaret, weve heard it again tonight and Im not surprised, the labels. I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left. In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control. And this is something Republicans have used for a long time. They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy. Its not labels. Its our vision of America. And we have two fundamentally different visions of America. The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesnt think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are. I dont. I think this is a great country, because weve always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better. Weve always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward. And thats the kind of America I want. Thats the kind of leadership I want to provide. But I dont think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues. Theres nothing the matter with that. But lets stop labeling each other and lets get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country. (Applause) Well, Andrea, weve just had another example of why the Vice Presidents mathematics just dont add up. I think you know because youve covered these issues, that theres no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget. Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon. Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but its going to be the President whos going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay. We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars. Were not going to spend billions on MXs on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we dont need, cant afford and wont help our defense posture at all. Were not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo. Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make. Yes, were going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent. Were going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces. But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions. Im prepared to make them, the Vice President is not. Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea. Thats an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent. I dont rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad. But there are limits to what we can spend. There are limits to this nations ability to finance these weapons systems. And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or wont address is the fact that you cant divorce our military security from our economic security. How can we build a strong America militarily thats teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt? And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger. So military security and economic security go hand in hand. And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. Were going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported. And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and theyll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions. And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment. And all of these things are going to have to be addressed. Thats why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same. I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free. But we cannot continue to live on a credit card. We cannot continue to tell the American people that were going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America. And thats the kind of America I want to build. Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann. But there are many people who I admire in this country today. Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress. Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me. I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive. We were proud of them. We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us. I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had. And hes a hero. I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people. Because they inspire them. They teach them. But more than that, they are role models. Members of the clergy who have done the same. Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support. I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids. So there are many, many heroes in this country today. These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month. In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models. And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come. I didnt hear the word liberal or left one time. I thank you for that. And doesnt that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, theyre all making good livings. They cant live in the community which they grew up in. Those are basic American values. I believe in them. I think you believe in them. Theyre not left or right. Theyre decent American values. I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in. We may have different approaches. We may think that you deal with them in different ways. But theyre basically American, I believe in them. George Bush believes in them. I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them. And I hopeSHAW: Governor. the tone weve just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign. I think the American people would appreciate that. (Applause) Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had And, incidentally, may I say that thats the decision of the Congress, and the president has concurred. I think I was on the advisory committee, Margaret. No, I dont happen to share that goal. Its an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we dont support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about. But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and thats what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesnt seem to want to make. And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I dont think theres any question about it. But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that weve made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas And some domestic programs as well, Andrea. May I disagree with the premise of your question? As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans. We dont have an alternative. Well lose it when its taken out of our paycheck before we even get it. But its the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we arent collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country. And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time. The Dorgan Task Force, which included two internal revenue commissioners, one a Republican, one a Democrat. It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds. The point is youve got to have a president whos prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state thats had very, very successful experience at doing this. In my own state, we did it. In other states, weve done it. Republican governors as well as Democratic governors. And weve had great success at revenue enforcement. Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that its going to take an army of IRS collectors again. Well, his campaign manager, who used to be the secretary of the treasury, was taking great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the Congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue agents to go out and collect these funds, and Im happy to join Jim Baker in saying that we agree on this. But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin its going to take at least the first year of the new administration. But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than thatSHAW: Governor. and thats where you begin. Andrea, I dont know which George Bush Im listening to. George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.BUSH: Oh, come on. And in 1985, he flew back from the West Coast to cut that COLA. I voted against that at the National Governors Association. We won a majority, we didnt win the two-thirds that was necessary nor to pass that resolution, George. But everybody knew what we were doing and Ive opposed that. The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once theyre elected and start cutting. You did it in 1985. The Administration tried to do it repeatedly, repeatedly in 81 82. And Im sure youll try to do it again. Because theres no way you can finance what you want to spend. Theres no way you can pay for that five year, $40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those weapons systems you want to buy unless you raid the Social Security Trust Fund. (Applause) If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause) that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November. (Cheers and Applause) And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination. You know, Mr. Bush has never appointed a judge. Ive appointed over 130, so I have a record. (Laughter) And Im very proud of it. I dont ask people whether theyre Republicans or Democrats. Ive appointed prosecutors, Ive appointed defenders. I dont appoint people I think are liberal or people who think - who I think are conservative. I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the Bench. And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States. These appointments are for life. These appointments are for life. And when the Vice President talks about liberals on the Bench, I wonder who hes talking about? Is he talking about a former Governor of the State of California, who is a former prosecutor, a Republican named Earl Warren, because I think Chief Justice Earl Warren was an outstanding Chief Justice and I think most Americans do too. Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means? Now, two-thirds of the people in this country who receive Social Security checks live entirely on that check; they have no other income. And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985. Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things weve had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare. Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but its going to cost, and thats going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens. It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support. But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country. So Im not going to begin, and Im not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when were spending billions on something like Star Wars, when were spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means. Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance. I talked in our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and millions of welfare families to get off of welfare, and Im proud to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill And the Ruby Samsons and Dan Lawsons, hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers in this country and in my state and across the country who today are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you provide training to those welfare mothers, some daycare for their children so that those mothers can go into a training program and get a decent job.SHAW: Governor Thats the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time. That is absolutely not true. That is absolutely not true. It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security. It had to do with the discussion we had had the previous day on the overall question of reducing the budget. No, and I have to (Applause) I just have to correct the record. That simply isnt true. Now, were not a parliamentary body, the National Governors Association. We vote on resolutions. If you dont get a two-thirds, then your resolution doesnt pass. But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically. And I never made that statement; never would. The point is that as we look at this nations future, and we have two very different visions of this future. I want to move ahead. The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light. Im interested in 240 million points of light. Im interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country. But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just dont believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who cant make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country. The Vice President did call Social Security a few years ago basically or largely a welfare program. It isnt. Its a contract between generations. Its something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement. Its a very sacred contract, and I believe in it. So thats not where we ought to go. There are plenty of places to cut. Theres lots we can do in the Pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets at the expense of the American taxpayer. There are we certainly ought to be able toSHAW: Governor Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and Im sure we can do that. Thats where we ought to go, and those are the programs we ought to review first. Margaret, Im not sure I can get all of this in in one minute. George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill. Its called set-asides. Secondly, if you were so opposed to the grain embargo, why did you ask the godfather of the grain embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisers? Im against the grain embargo; it was a mistake. Im also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose. That was a mistake as well, and it cost thousands of jobs for American workers in the Midwest and all over the United States of America. Margaret, once again, I dont know which George Bush Im talking about here or looking at. The George Bush who was the charter member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to Washington in the early 80s and did a job on the EPA, or the one weve been seeing and listening to the past two or three months. But let me say this, because he spent millions and millions of dollars of advertising on the subject of Boston Harbor. George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years. Im the first governor to clean it up. No thanks to you. No thanks to you. Weve been cleaning it up for four years. We passed landmark legislation in 84. No thanks to you. You did everything you could to kill the Clean Water ActSHAW: Governor. And those grants which make it possible for states and local communities to clean up rivers and harbors and streams. (Applause) I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates. (Laughter, boos) Thats my five seconds. Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues. Yes, we have fundamental differences. I think a great many of them have come out today. And I think if we get rid of the labels--and Im not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label liberal at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, Id qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away. (Laughter, applause) Isnt that the point? Most Americans believe in basic values. We have differences about how to achieve them. I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward. I am concerned about the fact that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking and nearly half of the real estate in the city of Los Angeles are in the hands of foreign investors. I am concerned about what that does to our future. Im concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits. But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success. I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent. But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces. And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, theres no way that you can do all of these things and do them well. Thats why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make. But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions. I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America. Lets get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we cant get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region. And I think thats one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East. Lets go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence. The democratic leaders of Central and Latin America want to work with us. Ive met with them, I know them, Ive spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen. We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us. But not a one of those key democratic leaders support our policy in Central America. And weve got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries. Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them. Well, its a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us whats been going on. This is another example of misplaced priorities. An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we dont need and cant afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons. Yes, if we dont do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons. Whats been going on? Whos been in charge? Whos been managing this system? Why have there been these safety violations? Why are these plants being closed down? I dont know what the latest cost estimates are, but its going to be in the range of 25, 50, 75, $100 billion. Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this. Maybe the Vice President has an answer. But Im somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff. And thats something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have. And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; its an American issue. But here again, I dont know which George Bush Im listening to. Wasnt this the George Bush that supported Mr. Meese? Called James Watt an excellent Secretary of the Interior? Provided support for some of these people, supported the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court of the United States. Weve had dozens weve had dozens and dozens of officials in this Administration who have left under a cloud, who have left with the special prosecutor in their arm, have been indicted, convicted. This isnt the kind of Administration we need. And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards well set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people were looking for. I picked Lloyd Bentsen. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle. I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards well set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration. 28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles. I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my partys nominee for president. Thats America. Thats why Im proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country. 26 days from today you and millions of Americans will choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice president of the United States. Our opponents say, things are okay. Dont rock the boat. Not to worry. They say we should be satisfied. But I dont think we can be satisfied when were spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bushs prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich. We can do better than that. Not working with government alone, but all of us working together. Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people. And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future. Kitty and I are very grateful to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that youve given to us in your homes and communities all across this country. We love you, and were grateful to you for everything that youve given to us. And we hope that well be serving you in the White House in January of 1989. Thank you, and God bless you. (Applause)\"\"\",\"\"\" Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values. And here I do have, on this particular question, a big difference with my opponent. You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and Id say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it. And Im glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins. And so we just have an honest difference of opinion Id have confidence in him. And I made a good selection. And Ive never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life. And Ive never seen a presidential campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice presidential nominee; never seen one before. (Applause) But you know, Lloyd Bentsen jumped on Dan Quayle, when Dan Quayle said, hes had roughly the same amount of experience. He had two terms in the Congress. He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term. He founded authored, the job training partnership act. It says to American working men and women that are thrown out of work for no fault of their own that theyre going to have jobs. Were moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing. He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze. If wed listened to them, we would never have had a treaty. And so I have great confidence in him. And its turning around. You know, the American people are fair. They dont like it when theres an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people. They want to judge it on the record itself. And so Im proud of my choice. And you know, I dont think age is the only criterion. But Ill tell you something, Im proud that people who are 30 years old and 40 years old now have someone in their generation that is going to be vice president of the United States of America. I made a good selection. The American people are seeing it, and Im proud of it; thats what Id say. And he could do the job. No, because Im pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up. And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years. And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going. I dont want to kill it off by a tax increase. More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force. And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes. And I dont want to do that, and I wont do that. And what I have proposed is something much better. And its going to take discipline of the executive branch; its going to take discipline of the congressional branch. And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending. I hear this talk about a blank check. The American people are pretty smart The Governor has to balance the budget in his state he is required to by law. He has raised taxes several times. I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto. (Applause) Id like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful. And I wont do one other thing that hes had to do I dont think its a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader. I think its whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the peoples ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think its a question of values, not likability or loveability, its a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because youd know exactly how to begin. You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace. Youve got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we cant turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations. It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country. And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think Id be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood. (Applause)BUSH: Please. What was he referring to? I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think weve come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off. And what Ive had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope Ive done it fairly. And the reason Ive had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record. And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesnt matter, just competence. And in the process the negatives began. It wasnt me that was there at that convention. Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didnt have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention. And Im not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down. I didnt do that. But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position hes the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat. Hes the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU. And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda. Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left. I support that. But what I dont like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if hes unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesnt matter, I dont agree with him. (Applause) If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and werent protected by the Congress, they wouldnt be in the budget. They would not be in the budget, but you want one now? Ill give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, thats cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didnt request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget. I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies. It is new and it is very very different than whats happened, but its not quite ready to be totally implemented. But its very important. I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and Im very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me. So, its not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste. I dont believe that. I do think this. Were in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks. And were protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces. My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with. But we are protecting both of them. We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now. The Soviets are modernizing. They continue to modernize and we cant simply weve got enough nuclear weapons, lets freeze. We cant do that. We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain. And, so, thats the way Id reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.SHAW: Governor Dukakis, one minute. I think the foremost (Applause) Can we start the clock over? I held off for the applause.SHAW: You can proceed, sir. I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country. The Governor talks about limits, what we cant do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, well develop some new kind of a missile. It takes eight years, ten years, to do that. He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons. And thank God, the freeze people were not heard. They were wrong. And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength. And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons. You just dont make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves. World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace. And Im proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that. Peace through strength works. I think of a teacher right here, largely Hispanic school, Jaime Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of them going on to college. I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail. Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba. I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this. I agree with the Governor on athletics. And theres nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace. I think of Dr. Fauci. Probably never heard of him. You did, Ann heard of him. Hes a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS. But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States. He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.SHAW: Mr. Vice President And the cynics abounded. And he is leaving office with a popularity at an all-time high, because American people say, he is our hero. (Applause) Youre stealing my close. I had something very nice to say in there. No, let me tell you something about that. And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention. And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there. And Im saying to Barbara, you know, weve always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us. You all know me, and weve held it back a little. But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him. And weve got a strong family. And we watched that. And we said, hey, weve got to unleash the Bush kids. And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention. You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses. And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect. And I would say, I dont know whether thats kind or not, its just an objective statement. I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise. Because its gotten a little ugly out there. Its gotten a little nasty. Its not much fun sometimes. And I would cite again Dan Quayle. Ive been in politics a long time, and I dont remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed. Now, come on. So some of it is unfair. But hes in the arena. Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter. Hes in there. So I salute these things. I salute those who participate in the political process. Sam Raybum had a great expression on this. He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage. Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either. Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.SHAW: Governor, a one-minute response. Thats not bad. Thats true. Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother. Let me answer your question and I hope it doesnt get too personal or maudlin. Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin. I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live. And I said, what can we do about it. He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live. We took the child to New York. Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died. If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life. And so I dont think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time. I think human life is very, very precious. And, look, this hasnt been an easy decision for me to meet. I know others disagree with it. But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption. And so I just feel this is where Im coming from. And it is personal. And I dont assail him on that issue, or others on that issue. But thats the way I, George Bush, feel about it. (Scattered applause) The defense budget today takes far less percentage of the gross national product than it did in President Kennedys time, for example moved tremendously. And you see, I think were facing a real opportunity for world peace. This is a big question. And its a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace. See, I dont believe any other country can pick up the mantel. I served at the UN. I dont think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else. So, what Im saying is, we are going to have to make choices. I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down. But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts. And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts. The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification. And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, providedSHAW: Mr. Vice President We dont give away our hand before we sit down at the head table. (Applause) Well, Andrea, you didnt predicate that lack of economists support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept. And I think where I differ with the Governor of Massachusetts, because I am optimistic. They jumped on me yesterday for being a little optimistic about the United States. I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going. I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isnt the end of the world. And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending. And we are doing a better job of it. The Congress is doing a better job of it. And the dynamics work. But they dont work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that. The American working man and woman are not taxed too little. The Federal Government continues to spend too much. (Applause)BUSH: Hold it. More so you than me. No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created. It wasnt created as a welfare program. It wasnt created that is it was created as a whole retirement or supplement to retirement program. It wasnt created as a welfare program. So, heres whats happened. We came into office and the Social Security Trust Fund was in great jeopardy and the President took the leadership working with the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress some tough calls were made and the Social Security Trust Fund was put back into sound, solvent condition. So, I dont want to fool around with it. And there are several theres a good political reason because its just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security. It always works that way. Ive seen it. In precinct politics in Texas and Ive seen it at the national level. We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound. And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I dont want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose. I dont want that. And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security. I learned that the hard way and the Governor and I both supported slipping the COLAs for one year. He supported it at the National Governors Conference and I supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and we got assailed by the Democrats in the election over that. And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, youre going to have to take another look at it, but not now. We do not have to do it. Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country. One I dont have a list yet. I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident. (Laughter) Secondly, I dont have any litmus test. But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution. I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench. They dont like the use of the word, but may I remind his strong supporters that only last year in the primary, to capture that Democratic nomination, he said, I am a progressive liberal Democrat. I wont support judges like that. There is no litmus test on any issue. But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret. And I dont have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments.COMPTON: Including Bork? Yeah. I supported him. (Applause) I think Ive addressed it. But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs. And I voted the same way that he did three months before in a national governors conference. And he said at that time, in a quote, and this is a paraphrase, a freeze, thats easy. So I dont believe that we need to do what youve suggested here. And Ive said that Im going to keep this Social Security entitlement, to keep that trust fund sound. But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children. And I have made some good sound proposals. But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example. You see, I want the families to have the choice. I dont want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers. I dont want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you cant do this any more. Were going to tell you how to do it all. I want flexibility, and I do you know, these people laugh about the thousand points of light. You ought to go out and see around this country whats happening in the volunteer section Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies. We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture. He favors this supply maintenance or production controls. He said that. Hes been out in the state saying that, in Midwestern states. I dont. I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation. And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what Im suggesting. In the first place, never go back to that Democratic grain embargo, that liberal Democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right out from under us and made Mr. Gorbachev say to me when I was here, how do I know youre reliable suppliers? We never should go back to that. And we ought to expand our markets abroad. We ought to have rural enterprise zones. We ought to move forward swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn, and therefore, create a bigger market for our agricultural products. But lets not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.SHAW: Mr. Vice President. The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back. 90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent. Its almost you remember that expression, get the lead out? Its almost out. Almost gone. Clean water? Im for clean water. But what Im not for what Im not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does. We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water. But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit. I am for clean water. Ive been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life. Ive been to these national parks. I led for the Earl Wallop bill or formerly Dingell-Johnson. I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late 60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side. I led for that. And so I refuse to measure ones commitment as to whether youre going to double the spending. That is the same old argument thats gotten us into trouble on the deficit side. So Ill just keep saying, I am one. Im not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey. Im not going to do that. That boo was excessively loud. Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness? Come on, give me five. I mean, this guy, this is too much. But Im not going to do that. Im an environmentalist. I believe in our parks. I believe in the Presidents commission on outdoors. And Ill do a good job, because I am committed. No. I will not agree to another debate. The American people are up to here with debates. They had thirty of them; we had seven of them. Now weve got three of them. I am going to carry this election debate all across this country in the last whatever remains of the last three and a half weeks, or whatever we have and the answer is no; I am not going to have any more debates, we dont need any more debates. Ive spelled out my position. In terms of negative campaigning, you know, I dont want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union. And the reason weve gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze. My opponent had trouble, criticized us, on our policy in Angola. It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola. We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan. That wouldnt have stopped if we hadnt been willing wouldnt have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadnt even been willing to support the freedom fighters there. And the policy in Central America, regrettably, has failed because the Congress has been unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom. Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country. That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, thats about as close as Ive ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe. Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant? Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department? I hope he will. This sounds like real progress here, because weve had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base. I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power. I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced. And therefore, Ive made some proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more incentive going in to look for, and find, and produce oil; made some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production. But were going to have to use more gas, more coal and more safe nuclear power for our energy base. So I am one who believes that we canSHAW: Mr. Vice President. and must do what hes talking about now. Yes, and Ill apply it to Congress too. Ill do both. Ill do both. Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service. I believe that public service is honorable. And I dont think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray. His chief education adviser is in jail Hes in jail because he betrayed the public trust. The head of education. And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish. He said that a fish rots from the head down as he was going after Ed Meese. Look, we need the highest possible ethical standards. I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the Presidents personal concern. I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress. I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service. But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me. And its a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you cant legislate morality. But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that Ive got a good record. And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch. And so it isnt one and state governments have had a tough time. His some of his college presidents arent exactly holier than thou. So lets not be throwing stones about it. Lets say, this isnt Democrat or Republican, and it isnt liberal or conservative. Lets vow to work together to do something about it. Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light. So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage. But we have enormous differences. I want to hold the line on taxes, and keep this the longest expansion in modern history going until everybody in America benefits. I want to invest in our children. Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation. And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control. I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and thats why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals. Thats why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required. I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream. There is much to be done. This election is about big things. And perhaps the biggest is world peace. And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world. America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible. And we have now achieved an historic arms control agreement. I want to build on that. Id love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, Id like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth. Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth. And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth. And I ask for your support on November 8th. And I will be a good president. Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World. Thank you very, very much.\"\"\",\"\"\" For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two campaigns.

      "September 25 1988,MR. DUKAKIS,MR. BUSH,\"\"\" I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important. But its important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top. That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves. Here we are with a government thats been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator. Weve been dealing with him; hes been dealing drugs to our kids. Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences. I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governors Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help. Were providing that young woman with help. But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers. Values begin at the top, in the White House. Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989. Im saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention. And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand. But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we dont understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, its a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you. Now, Ive outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together. But we also have to take demand seriously. You know, we have five percent of the worlds population in this country. Were consuming 50 percent of the worlds cocaine. And in my state Im proud to say weve organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country. Were helping youngsters; were reaching out to them. And were beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and thats the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America. And weve got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances. I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or dont pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country. Yes, Ive been very specific about those, John. And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive thats balanced ten budgets in a row, Ive had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, Ive suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we dont need and we cant afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. Ive also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and Ive outlined those in detail. Secondly, weve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, weve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that arent being paid to this country. Its very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. Ive also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what weve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I dont understand about Mr. Bushs approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says hes against new taxes, although hes broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, hes going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.(Laughter) But I hope you wont take my five seconds away from me. I will say this - If hes serious about what hes saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think hes going to try it again. Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully. What hes proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that were going to give to people making $200,000 a year. Why thats more than the average teacher makes. Weve had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen. Weve run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined. Its time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country. But, George, thats no answer. Well, no, its no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who dont have a dime of health insurance and dont know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night. I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens. All of them with little or no health insurance. One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance. Has an 11 year old son and cant let that son compete in sports and Little League, because hes afraid hes going to get hurt and he wont be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills. My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state. The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because theyre paying for those who arent. And I think its time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance. Thats the way were going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.LEHRER: Follow-up, Anne? Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didnt know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts. I hope he hasnt. Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think its a model for what I hope we can do across the country. But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, dont you? It was in 1964 and thats what he called Medicare. Well, he was wrong then and hes wrong now. (Applause) Let me say this about AIDS. Its the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency weve had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January. And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where its appropriate and where its done carefully and responsibly. But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had. In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do. The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations. I think were both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor. Peter, I care deeply about people. All people. Working people, working families. People all over this country who in some cases are living from paycheck to paycheck. In other cases are having a hard time opening up the door of college opportunity to their children. In other cases dont have basic health insurance which, for most of us we accept as a matter of course, and assume we are going to have in order to pay the bills that we incur when we get sick. Im somebody who believes deeply in genuine opportunity for every single citizen in this country and thats the kind of passion I brought to my state. I was a leader in the Civil Rights movement in my state and in my legislature. I cared very deeply about that war in Vietnam...I thought it was a mistake, I thought it was wrong, and I was one of the few legislators early in that war that took a stand against the war. I think it was the right stand at that time and I think history has proved us to be correct. But I have learned over time. I served one term...I was defeated as you know, and defeat sometimes is an important lesson. I think I am a much better governor today...I think I am a much better person...a much better listener. I think Ill be a much better president for having gone through that experience. But the things that we have done in my state to bring opportunity to people on public assistance -- over 50,000 families on welfare that weve helped to move from welfare to work and to become productive citizens -- the universal healthcare bill that we just talked about which will guarantee health care for all of our citizens. The opening up of opportunity to minorities in my state, affirmative action, minority contracting. The fact that we have a three percent unemployment rate and more jobs than people to fill them which gives us a tremendous opportunity to reach out to everybody and make them a part of this wonderful nation of ours with the opportunity that we create. These are things that I believe in very, very deeply. I may be a little calmer than some about it. I may be a greater consensus builder these days than I used to be, and I think thats a good thing, but Im running for the presidency of the United States. Ive been in public service for 25 years because I believe deeply in American goals and values and the people of this country, and thats the kind of president I want to be.  Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this. Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism. I dont think theres any question about that, and I resent it. I resent it. My parents came to this country as immigrants. They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world. Im in public service because I love this country. I believe in it. And nobodys going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly. The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of ones patriotism--the vice presidents been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years. To the best of my knowledge hes never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.(Applause) Mr. Bush, I dont question your patriotism. When youre attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it. I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment. Those are the concerns of the people that are watching us tonight. Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each others patriotism and loyalty. Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who dont have health insurance. The problem, Mr. Bush, is that youve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, youve have homeless families. We didnt have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. Weve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. Weve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids cant afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. Thats an essential commitment. And I think the housing community is ready. But its going to take a president whos committed to housing, whos had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream. And while Im all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply wont do. Weve got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and Im prepared to do so. This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country. Well, I certainly hope not. And its all a question of what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values. I agree with him. What are our values? Isnt providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isnt it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something thats part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didnt sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, thats the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isnt a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. Ive talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, cant do it all. We shouldnt expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, thats a choice we have to make, isnt it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because its so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, thats the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesnt do. We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue. Its the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989. No, I dont think there is. There are two very different issues here, and theyve got to be dealt with separately. Im opposed to the death penalty. I think everybody knows that. Im also very tough on violent crime. And thats one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. Its one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. Its one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I dont favor abortion. I dont think its a good thing. I dont think most people do. The question is who makes the decision. And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.LEHRER: Response, Mr. Vice President. Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision. Its as simple as that. I dont think its enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I havent sorted it out. This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make. And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.BUSH: I just - Let me finish. Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think thats the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have. I respect his right to disagree with me. But I think its important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people. Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice presidents been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives. Its cut federal aid to education; its cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. Its taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and theyre still resisting. Thats the way you help people. Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I dont know what that means. I know what strong political leadership is. I know whats happened over the course of the past eight years. These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and theyve hurt kids all over this country. Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time. Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids dont lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children. Of course not. Of course thats a charge thats always made against any governor who runs for the presidency. I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980. Remember that, George? And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governorsFranklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt. I hope it isnt Christmas when you make that decision. Well, first let me say with respect to the freeze, that back in the spring of 1982 Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today. As a matter of fact, he said it was not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it was too important for the United States or for the world. I didnt hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do. It was a very different George Bush who was talking much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he is today. And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery. Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not. What were talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent. Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces. And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously. No, theres been no change of heart. I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, thats about a billion dollars a year. But I dont know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack. It makes real sense. And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983. Peter, its one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make. These are American citizens, we care deeply about them. Their families care deeply about them, want them back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back. Thats not true. Thats not true. 25th of December, Mr. Vice President.(Laughter)BUSH: I finished. He can have another ten seconds if he wants, Jim. Well, the matter of judgment is very important. And I think its important to understand what happened here. Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal. I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.(Applause)BUSH: Just the facts. But did Idid I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket? I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency. I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned. Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle. Well, John, Im a man thats been a chief executive for ten years. Ive picked a lot of people. Ive picked cabinets. Ive named judges. I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards. I try to meet them and I insist that people who work for me meet them, if they dont, they dont stick around very long. Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and weve got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currentlywhich they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we dont do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, well destroy their economies, destroy their future. And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers. This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family. Weve had an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in communities and states and regions to get to know you. Im more optimistic today than I was when I began about this nation providing we have the kind of leadership in Washington that can work with you, that can build partnerships, that can build jobs in every part of this country, not certain parts of this country.\"\"\",\"\"\" I think weve seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think thats all wrong. So weve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I dont believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But weve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. Weve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie - Crocodile Dundee. And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And its bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing. Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isnt a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem. But we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods. But I think were all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools. Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA. I asked for and received the same briefing. I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information. And what Im about to say is unclassified. Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega. It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice. And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him. And so I think its about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective. Panama is a friendly country. I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him. And we want to bring him to justice. And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations. Is this the time to unleash our one-liners? That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.(Laughter) Let me help the governor. There are so many things there, I dont quite know where to begin. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut. Its not going to cost the government money. Its going to increase revenues to the federal government, and its going to create jobs. So thats one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us. Massachusetts doesnt have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens to be a fact. And so lets kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think its good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes. I think its the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down. And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but weve got to get the Democrats - Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. Id like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is - its not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isnt that were taking too little - from taxpayer - were spending too much still. And the formula Ive given you works, weve put it through a good economic model, weve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there whos a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what Ive said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please lets learn from history. A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government. One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe thats the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people were talking about here. But weve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, We cant make it. And I think then youre going to see that people are put out of work. All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, Id love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isnt any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. Its a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance. But I just dont want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.LEHRER: A rebuttal, Governor? You dont like the answer, but its an answer. Well, were on the right track. The NIH is doing a good job in research. The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education. I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing. But we got to have a knowledge base. Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge. We cant simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing. Im Chairman of the Presidents Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help. And you got to be careful here, because theres a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes weve got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure. We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature. So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this. Well, I dont question his passion. I question - and I dont question his concern about the war in Vietnam. He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war. Now, thats a certain passion that in my view its misguided passion. He - we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion. He said, I am a strong liberal Democrat - August, 87. Then he said, I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU. That was what he said. He is out there on out of the mainstream. He is very passionate. My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left. And I wish we had time to let me explain. But I salute him for his passion. We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.(Applause) Nothings wrong with it. But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU. But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They dont like it when I say that he says hes a card carrying member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here. Ive seen it authoritatively written twice, and if Ive done him an injustice, and he didnt say it, Im very, very sorry. But I dont agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU. I simply dont want to see the ratings on movies. I dont want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie. I like those ratings systems. I dont think theyre right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I dont want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I dont want to see under God come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the ACLU. And I dont agree with them. He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal. I dont agree with that. I come from a different point. And I think Im more in touch with the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, Id have found a way to sign that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did. Im not questioning his patriotism. He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism. And then all the liberal columnists join in. I am not. I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where hes coming from He has every right to do it. But I believe thats not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesnt matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years. And thats all Im trying to do, is put it in focus. And I hope people dont think that Im questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.LEHRER: Governor, a response. I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded. I believe that that would help in terms of shelter. I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help. The governors wife has been very active in the homeless. My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Bakers wife. This isnt government. These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves. The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when its rough. And so I think that were on the right track. I dont see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work. And were on the track on this one. But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it. Id say around 30 percent. And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out. Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them. Because there is a major problem there. A lot of them are mentally sick. And weve got to attend to them. But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.LEHRER: Governor, a response. I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless. Lets talk about housing which the question was. When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House? Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent. Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing? Housing is up. We are serving a million more families now. But were not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars. Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort. It is wrong. I favor home ownership. I want to see more vouchers. I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down. Theyre half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, theyll be a lot less. But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and well go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one. Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique. It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole. The federal program doesnt do that. No other state programs do that. And I favor the death penalty. I know its tough and honest people can disagree. But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life. And I do believe it would be inhibiting. And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland. Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didnt want him to be furloughed again. And so we have a fundamental difference on this one. And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life. I favor adoption. I do not favor abortion. I havent sorted out the penalties. But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion. And I favor adoption. And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved. And you see, yes, my position has evolved. And its continuing to evolve, and its evolving in favor of life. And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother. Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but its much clearer for me now. As Ive seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes. See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do. But no, Im for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course theres got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.LEHRER: Governor. One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs youre talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs. But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe were going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs Im talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and thats why Im a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so its a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. Im for Head Start and moving that up. And Ive already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I dont think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.LEHRER: Governor. What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesnt understand what Im talking about. Well, I thought the question was about defense. The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West. And because we didnt listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age. Now, were sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability. That is not the way you deal with the Soviets. Ive met Mr. Gorbachev. Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day. These people are tough. But now we have a chance. I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world. And he just lifted martial law. And he just called for new elections. And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy. And out he goes. I dont think its a question of eliminating. I can tell him some Im against. A-6F, for example. DIVAD. And I can go on and on. Minuteman III, penetration systems. I mean, theres plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, Im not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game. Im simply not going to do that. Wouldnt it be nice to be perfect? wouldnt it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake? These are themy answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference. Im not reconsidering my position. Two questions Hes got to get this thing more clear. Why do you spend a billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud? I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can. Weve set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it. That is my position on SDI and its never wavered a bit. I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government. It is the best anti-terrorist report written. Yes, we shouldnt trade arms for hostages. But we have made vast improvements in our anti-terrorism. Now, its fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsoredfingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya. And my opponent was unwilling to support that action. And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down.DUKAKIS: Thats not true. And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter. And Ive said mistakes were made. Clearly nobodys going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages. That is a very serious charge against the president. The matter has been thoroughly looked into. But the point is sometimes the action(Laughter)  has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response. Youre judged by the whole record. Youre judged by the entire record. Are we closer to peace? Are we doing better in anti-terrorism? Should we have listened to my opponent who wanted to send the UN into the Persian Gulf or in spite of the mistakes of the past, are we doing better there? How is our credibility with the GCC countries on the Western side of the Gulf. Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace? You judge on the record. Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan? How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there andabout Angolanow, we have a chanceseveral Bostonians dont like it, but the rest of the country will understand.(Applause) Now we have a chance. Now we have a chance. And, so, I think that Id leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record. And let me say thisall he can talk abouthe goes around ranting about Noriega. Now, Ive told you what the intelligence briefing he received said about that. He can talk about Iran/Contra and alsoIll make a deal with you, I will take the blame for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all the good things that have happened in world peace since Ronald Reagan and I took over from the Carter administration.(Applause) I still have a couple of minutes left. And there is a difference principle LEHRER: Sorry, Mr. Vice President. Its only on yellow here. Wait a minute.(Laughter) I said I wasnt perfect. Where was I? I see a young man that was elected to the Senate twice, to the House of Representatives twice. I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30s and 40s. I see a man that took the leadership in the Job Training Partnership Act and that retrains people in this highly competitive changing society were in, so if a person loses his hob he is retrained for a benefitfor awork that will be productive and he wont have to go on one of these many programs that the liberaltalking about. No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd. Well, Iwe obviously have a difference. I believe it does meet the test. Well have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this.(Laughter) I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening. I wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him. But now weve got the lines too carefully drawn here. But you talk about judgment. I mean, what kind of judgmentI mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy. What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts? I mean, theresI dont think this is a fair argument. But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and hell do an outstanding job. I oppose supply management and production controls. I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction. I want to expand our markets abroad and thats why Ive called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture. I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country. But there are two main focal points of this election. Opportunity and peace.\"\"\",\"\"\"(Applause) Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters. The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush. It is a domestic question. You have two minutes for an answer, sir. The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs. What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs? Governor, you have one minute to respond. Governor, a follow-up question. You have two minutes to answer it. Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country? A minute to rebut, Mr. Vice President. All right, the next question will be asked by John Mashek. It goes to Governor Dukakis, and youll have two minutes to answer. Your two minutes is up, Governor. You have a minute to rebut. Your time is up, too. A follow-up, John. Governor, you have a minute to rebut. All right, the next question will be asked by Anne Groer and it will go the Vice President. You have two minutes to answer, sir. If I may interrupt at this point and caution the audience as I did before we went on the air, please hold it down. Youre only taking time away from your candidate when you do that. Governor, continue, please. Mr. Vice President, a minute of rebuttal. Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings. It goes to the Governor. Mr. Vice President, a rebuttal. Peter, a question? Question for the vice president, Peter. The time is up, governor. Lets go now to John Mashek, again. A question for the vice president. John, a question for the governor. A response, Mr. Vice President. All right, the next question is to the governor. Ann Groer will ask it. Question for the vice president, Ann? Peter Jennings, a question for the vice president. A question for the governor, Peter. All right, lets move now to some questions on foreign and national security policy. John Mashek will ask the first question of the governor. Mr. Vice President, your time is up. John, a question for the vice president. Anne Groer, a question for the Vice President. Anne Groer, a question for the Governor. Peter Jennings, a question for Governor Dukakis. A question for the Vice President. Peter? Im wrong. Go ahead. My apologies.BUSH: Jim LEHRER: You said nobodys perfect. Governor, you have a minute to respond. A question from John Mashek. It goes to the Vice President. John will ask a question of the Governor. It will be the last question and then the Vice President will have a rebuttal. Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago. There is time for one more question. Getting it in my ear and Ann Groer will ask it. Ann? To the Governor. All right. That really is the end. Now, lets go to closing statements. They will be two minutes each in duration by agreement. Vice President Bush goes first. Governor Dukakis second. Mr. Vice President.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 21 1984,Mr. Mondale,The President,\"\"\" I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America. Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area. To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area. We absolutely must, which is why I responded to your first question the way I did. Its much more complex. You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strengthand all at the same time. What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office? He raises his right hand and takes an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the laws of the land. A President cant know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws. Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether theyre living up to it; and follow-ups, wherever we find suggestions that theyre violating it; and the strongest possible terms. A President must know those things.Eastern Europe I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe. We ought to deal with each of these countries separately. We ought to pursue strategies with each of them, economic and the rest, that help them pull away from their dependence upon the Soviet Union. Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense. [Applause] I propose a budgetI have proposed a budget which would increase our nations strength, in real terms, by double that of the Soviet Union. No. As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country. And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America. What Im referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take stepsdiplomatic and otherwiseto prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it. Groucho Marx said, Who do you believe?me, or your own eyes? And what we have in Lebanon is something that the American people have seen. The Joint Chiefs urged the President not to put our troops in that barracks because they were indefensible. They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, Please, take them out of there. The Secretary of State admitted that this morning. He did not do so. The report following the explosion of the barracks disclosed that we had not taken any of the steps that we should have taken. That was the second time. No. And I have not made it an issue, nor should it be. Whats at issue here is the Presidents application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary. I read his statement the other day. I dont admire Fidel Castro at all. And Ive said that Che Guevara was a contemptible figure in civilizations history. I know the Cuban state as a police state, and all my life Ive worked in a way that demonstrates that. But Jesse Jackson is an independent person. I dont control him. There are two distinguished authors on arms control in this country-there are many others, but two that I want to cite tonight. One is Strobe Talbott in his classic book, Deadly Gambits. The other is John Neuhaus, whos one of the most distinguished arms control specialists in our country. Both said that this administration turned down the walk in the woods agreement first, and that would have been a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the United States in Europe and our security. This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with. I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so. That is the part that requires employers to determine the citizenship of an employee before theyre hired. Im convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed. I think thats wrong. Weve never had citizenship tests in our country before, and I dont think we should have a citizenship card today. That is counterproductive. I think youre right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so Im not doing it for political reasons. Im doing it because all my life Ive fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination. This bill imposes upon employers the responsibility of determining whether somebody who applies for a job is an American or not. And just inevitably, theyre going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent. One of the biggest problems today is that the countries to our south are so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their lives if they dont come north, come north despite all the risks. And if were going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people. And thats why this enormous national debt, engineered by this administration, is harming these countries in fueling this immigration. These high interest ratesreal rates that have doubled under this administrationhave had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache. And that drives our friends to the south up into our region, and we need to end those deficits as well. First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union. We have had for many years, understandably, a system of restraints on high technology because the Soviets are behind us. And any research or development along the Star Wars schemes would inevitably involve our most advanced computers, our most advanced engineering. And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-starter. I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all. Every system that is verifiable should be placed on the table for negotiations for an agreement. I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldnt verify every day. I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported. Thats why we say mutual and verifiable freezes. and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop. Well, thats what a Presidents supposed to knowwhere those weapons are going to be. If theyre space weapons, I assume theyll be in space. [Laughter] If theyre antisatellite weapons, I assume theyre going to be aimed against satellites. No. As a matter of fact, we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provides all the bargaining chips that we need. And I support the air launch cruise missile, the ground launch cruise missile, the Pershing missile, the Trident submarine, the D-5 submarine, Stealth technology, the Midgetmanwe have a whole range of technology. Why I disagree with the MX is that its a sitting duck. Itll draw an attack. It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon. And the B-1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B-1. The Secretary of Defense himself said it would be a suicide mission if it were built. I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, thats not verifiable. Lets take your warhead principle. The warhead principle-there have been counting rules for years. Whenever a weapon is tested we count the number of warheads on it, and whenever that warhead is used we count that number of warheads, whether they have that number or less on it, or not. These are standard rules. I will not agree to any production restrictionsor agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements. I dont trust the Russians. I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day. In other words, weve got to be tough. But in order to stop this arms madness, weve got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.Support for U.S. Allies Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administrations policies on human rights. I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels. I would like to see their elimination. And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts US. I want to thank the League of Women Voters, the good citizens of Kansas City, and President Reagan for agreeing to debate this evening.\"\"\",\"\"\" No, but Im glad you asked that question, because I know its on many peoples minds. I have ordered an investigation. I know that the CIA is already going forward with one. We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advisingsupposedly on military tacticsthe contras. And he drew up this manual. It was turned over to the agency head of the CIA in Nicaragua to be printed. And a number of pages were excised by that agency head there, the man in charge, and he sent it on up here to CIA, where more pages were excised before it was printed. But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA. Im afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua. Theres not someone there directing all of this activity. There are, as you know, CIA men stationed in other countries in the world and, certainly, in Central America. And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations. Yes. I have so many things there to respond to, Im going to pick out something you said earlier. Youve been all over the country repeating something that, I will admit, the press has also been repeating-that I believed that nuclear missiles could be fired and then called back. I never, ever conceived of such a thing. I never said any such thing. I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union. I retract nothing that I have said. I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have. But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other. And I told Mr. Gromyko we dont like their system. They dont like ours. And were not going to change their system, and they sure better not try to change ours. But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it. And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons. And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding. Ah, well, now youve added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight. I am not going to make the decision as to what the tactics could be, but obviously there are a number of areas in the world that are of importance to us. One is the Middle East, and that is of interest to the whole Western World and the industrialized nations, because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there. Our neighbors here in America are vital to us. Were working right now in trying to be of help in southern Africa with regard to the independence of Namibia and the removal of the Cuban surrogates, the thousands of them, from Angola. Yes. Im not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here. But with regard to whether Mr. Mondale would be strong, as he said he would be, I know that he has a commercial out where hes appearing on the deck of the Nimitz and watching the F-14s take off. And thats an image of strengthexcept that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldnt have been any Nimitz to stand onhe was against it. [Laughter] Indeed, he was on that side virtually throughout all his years in the Senate. And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget. No, Morton, I dont agree to all of those things. First of all, when we and our alliesthe Italians, the French, and the United Kingdomwent into Lebanon, we went in there at the request of what was left of the Lebanese Government to be a stabilizing force while they tried to establish a government. Morton, no. I think theres a great difference between the Government of Iran threatening our diplomatic personnel, and there is a government that you can see and can put your hand on. In the terrorist situation, there are terrorist factions all over. In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed. The most recent has been the one in Brighton. In dealing with terrorists, yes, we want to retaliate, but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the lives of innocent civilians there in the various communities and in the city of Beirut where these terrorists are operating. Yes. First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks. That was a command decision made by the commanders on the spot and based with what they thought was best for the men there. That is one. Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponents youth and inexperience. [Laughter and applause] If I still have time, I might add, Mr. Trewhitt, I might add that it was Seneca or it was Cicero, I dont know which, that said, If it was not for the elders correcting the mistakes of the young, there would be no state.Strategic Missiles Yes, this had to do with our disarmament talks. And the whole controversy about land missiles came up because we thought that the strategic nuclear weapons, the most destabilizing are the land-based. You put your thumb on a button and somebody blows up 20 minutes later. So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those. And then we made it plain, a second phase, take up the submarine-launched or the airborne missiles. Yes. I know itll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge. And, as a matter of fact, we havent avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union. Very early in my administration I proposedand I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administrationI proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10and still havebetter than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe. When they protested that and suggested a smaller number, perhaps, I went along with that. Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill stronglyand the bill that came out of the Senate. However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill. And in conferencewe stayed with them in conference all the way to where even Senator Simpson did not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee. There were a number of things in there that weakened that bill. I cant go into detail about them here. No. As a matter of fact, the population explosion, if you look at the actual figures, has been vastly exaggeratedover exaggerated. As a matter of fact, there are some pretty scientific and solid figures about how much space there still is in the world and how many more people we can have. Its almost like going back to the Malthusian theory, when even then they were saying that everyone would starve with the limited population they had then. But the problem of population growth is one, here, with regard to our immigration. And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they dont have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs. And this is what were trying to work out, not only to protect our own borders but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem. Well, my rebuttal is Ive heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border [laughter] and it has nothing to do with it. Mr. Kalb, I think what has been hailed as something Im supposedly, as President, discussing as principle is the recall of just some philosophical discussions with people who are interested in the same things; and that is the prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon, and so forth, and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that. But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow. So, I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon. Why not? What if we did-and I hope we can; were still researching-what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete? There has never been a weapon invented in the history of man that has not led to a defensive, a counter-weapon. But suppose we came up with that? Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Unionno, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, Now, are you willing to join us? Heres what wegive them a demonstration and then sayHeres what we can do. Now, if youre willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then well give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that were both got something that if anyone tries to cheat ....  Morton, I did criticize the President because of our undercutting of what was a stalwart allythe Shah of Iran. And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen. The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down. Have things gotten better? The Shah, whatever he might have done, was building low-cost housing, had taken land away from the Mullahs and was distributing it to the peasants so they could be landownersthings of that kind. But we turned it over to a maniacal fanatic who has slaughtered thousands and thousands of people, calling it executions. Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow. And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States. And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific. Well, the invasion of Afghanistan didnt take place on our watch. I have described what has happened in Iran, and we werent here then either. I dont think that our record of human rights can be assailed. I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world. Yes. My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting. All right. I was just going to\"\"\",\"\"\"\"\"\"\n",
      "October 7 1984,Mr. Mondale,The President,\"\"\" One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation. And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits. Absolutely, and I proposed over a hundred billion dollars in cuts in Federal spending over 4 years, but I am not going to cut it out of Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and things-- [applause] --that people need. These people depend upon all of us for the little security that they have, and Im not going to do it that way. Well, thats exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits. And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent-reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying--with widows trying to get them through college. Everybody remembers that; people know what happened. Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what Im saying. There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil. And its also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children. Well, I guess Im reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover. He said, Its not what he doesnt know that bothers me; its what he knows for sure that just aint so. [Laughter] The fact of it is: The Presidents budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent. Its not an opinion; its a fact. And when the President was asked the other day, What do you want to cut in the budget?, he said, Cut those things I asked for but didnt get. Thats Social Security and Medicare. First of all, I accept President Reagans affirmation of faith. Im sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact. What I object to-- [applause] --what I object to--what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others. The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges. And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges. And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life. My answer is that this campaign isnt over yet. And when people vote, I think youre going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that Im talking about. Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit. The President says itll disappear automatically. Ive said its going to take some work. I think the American people will draw their own conclusions. The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it. The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon. I was chairman of Minnesotans for Kennedy; President Reagan was chairman of a thing called Democrats for Nixon. Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but Ill be proud of supporting him all of my life. And Im very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government. This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated. I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people. The basic decision of the Supreme Court is that each person has to make this judgment in her own life, and thats the way its been done. And its a personal and private, moral judgment. I dont know the answer to when life begins. And its not that simple, either. Youve got another life involved. And if its rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that? If its incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that? Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment? It wont work. [Applause] I agree with that, and thats why I was a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law, so that more of these children could come to term, so that the young mothers were educated, so we found an option, an alternative. Im all for that. But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued. And I dont agree with it. In my opinion, as we deal with this deficit, people from about $70,000 a year on down have to be dealt with very, very carefully, because they are the ones who didnt get any relief the first time around. The first thing is, everybody 25,000 and under would have no tax increase. Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal. Im just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and thats whats happening all over this country with wealthy Americans. Theyve got so many loopholes they dont have to pay much in taxes. You remember the last time you said that?The President. Mm-hmm. You said it when President Carter said that you were going to cut Medicare, and you said, Oh, no, there you go again, Mr. President. And what did you do right after the election? You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare. And so, when you say, There you go again--people remember this, you know. [Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do? Youve got a $260 billion deficit. You cant wish it away. You wont slow defense spending; you refuse to do that-- Number one, weve got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed. I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent. I think they stand for civil rights. I know theyre all for education in science and training, which I strongly support. They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest. I think the business community wants to get involved. I think theyre asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved. I think thats part of it. I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that theyre not having to take money thats desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else. Im opposed to that, too.Ms. Walters. And now it is time for our rebuttal for this period. Mr. President? Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits dont have anything to do with interest rates. I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why--energy prices and so on. Theres no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, whats called the real interest rates--the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled--and thats still the case today. And the result is interest costs that have never been seen before in terms of real charges, and its attributable to the deficit. Do you want to give me some suggestions? [Laughter] Im going to use my time a little differently. Im going to give the President some credit. I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and hes entitled to credit for that. What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with Americas problems. Without any doubt, I have stood up and told the American people that that $263 billion deficit must come down. And Ive done what no candidate for President has ever done, I told you before the election what Id do. Well, weve just finished almost the whole debate. And the American people dont have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits. [Laughter] And yet, thats the most important single issue of our time. I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evenings debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didnt have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it.\"\"\",\"\"\" I have a plan--not a secret plan. As a matter of fact, it is the economic recovery program that we presented when I took office in 1981. The deficit is the result of excessive government spending. I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasnt going to take place to begin with. But it has taken place. Yes. I dont believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nations history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, youre taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down governments share of what it is taking. Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since youve asked it. And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security-before I get to the answer to your question--the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916. Our policy was not to cut subsidies. We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure. And this is what weve been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships. Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security. When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldnt solve them for 5. Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983. Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy. In our particular church, we did not use that term, born again, so I dont know whether I would fit that--that particular term. But I have--thanks to my mother, God rest her soul--the firmest possible belief and faith in God. And I dont believe--I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not--I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others. And I do resort to prayer. The answer to your question is very simple about why I dont go to church. I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington. And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut--were supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand--but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church. Yes, its very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale. I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there. The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion. And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they cant do it because its school property. These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that. Well, again, Im running on the record. I think sometimes Mr. Mondales running away from his. But Im running on the record of what we have asked for. Well continue to try to get things that we didnt get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government. And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago--I know, because I was a Democrat at that time. And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people. There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and youve named some of them. Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down--or since weve kept records--2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that weve had. I think that weve had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide. Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States. And so, my change had come earlier than that. I hadnt gotten around to reregistering as yet. I found that was rather difficult to do. But I finally did it. Do you consider abortion murder or a sin? And second, how hard would you work--what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal? And specifically, would you make certain, as your party platform urges, that Federal justices that you appoint be pro-life? I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life. Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life. But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is-theres been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government. With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, its a problem of the Constitution. The laws regarding that always were State laws. It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy. Our laws against murder are State laws. So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this. Yes. Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isnt that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that? You know, I wasnt going to say this at all, but I cant help it. There you go again. [Laughter] I dont have a plan to tax--or increase taxes. Im not going to increase taxes. I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes. Yes, I had used--last resort would always be with me. If you got the Government down to the lowest level, that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the services for the people, and if the recovery was so complete that you knew you were getting the ultimate amount of revenues that you could get through that growth, and there was still some slight difference there between those two lines, then I had said once that, yes, you would have to then look to see if taxes should not be adjusted. Yes. With regard to Medicare, no, but its time for us to say that Medicare is in pretty much the same condition that Social Security was, and something is going to have to be done in the next several years to make it fiscally sound. And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem. And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.Ms. Walters. All right. Fine. I gave you back some of that time. [Laughter] Well, some of those facts and figures just dont stand up. Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here. It has begun to decline, but it is still going up. That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything. I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject. I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that were finding all over America. And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people. So, that was the only place that that was used. Yes. The connection thats been made again between the deficit and the interest rates--there is no connection between them. There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited--that the interest rates came down from 21 1/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up. Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down. Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me. Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment. In 1979 he made similar statements, the same effect, that the deficits-there was nothing wrong with having deficits. No, I might as well just go with- I dont think so. Im all confused now. Well, well include it in that.Ms. Walters. Okay. Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question. I asked: Are you better off than you were 4 years before? The answer to that obviously was no, and as the result, I was elected to this office and promised a new beginning.\"\"\",\"\"\" Mr. President, in 1980 you promised the American people--in your campaign--a balanced budget by 1983. Weve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years youve been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight? Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has some bad news. The lines arent about to meet, according to their projections. They project that the budget deficit will continue to climb. In the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $273 billion. Mr. Mondale, the Carter-Mondale administration didnt come close to balancing the budget in its 4 years in office either, despite the fact that President Carter did promise a balanced budget during his term. Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isnt it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit? After that discussion, this may be like going from the sublime to the ridiculous, but here goes. I have a political question for you, Mr. Mondale. [Laughter] Mr. Mondale, isnt it possible that the American people have heard your message--and they are listening--but they are rejecting it? Mr. President, you and your party are benefiting from what appears to be an erosion of the old Democratic coalition, but you have not laid out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond November 6th. What is your program for America for the next decade, with some specificity? Mr. President, much of what you said affects the quality of life of many Americans--their income, the way they live, and so forth--but theres an aspect to quality of life that lies beyond the private sector which has to do with our neighborhoods, our cities, our streets, our parks, our environment. In those areas, I have difficulty seeing what your program is and what you feel the Federal responsibility is in these areas of the quality of life in the public sector that affects everybody, and even enormous wealth by one individual cant create the kind of environment that he might like. Mr. President, the economic recovery is real, but uneven. The Census Bureau, just a month ago, reported that there are more people living under poverty now, a million more people living under it, than when you took office.There have been a number of studies, including studies by the Urban Institute and other nonpolitical organizations, that say that the impact of the tax and budget cuts and your economic policies have impacted severely on certain classes of Americans-working mothers, head of households, minority groups, elderly poor. In fact, theyre saying the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under your policies. Mr. President, in a visit to Texas--in Brownsville, I believe it was, in the Rio Grande Valley--you did observe that the economic recovery was uneven.The President. Yes. In that particular area of Texas, unemployment was over 14 percent, whereas statewide, it was the lowest in the country, I believe--5.6 percent. And you made the comment, however, that man does not live by bread alone. What did you mean by that comment? And if I interpret it correctly, it would be a comment more addressed to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain them, with their wherewithal. Mr. Mondale, as you can gather from the question to the President, the celebrated War on Poverty obviously didnt end the problem of poverty, although it may have dented it. The poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged are still with us. What should the Federal Governments role be to turn back the growth in the number of people living below the poverty level, which is now 35 million in the United States, and to help deal with the structural unemployment problems that the President was referring to in an uneven recovery? Mr. Mondale, is it possible that the vast majority of Americans who appear to be prosperous have lost interest in the kinds of programs youre discussing to help those less privileged than they are?\"\"\"\n",
      "October 28 1980,THE PRESIDENT,GOVERNOR REAGAN,\"\"\" Mr. Stone, Ive had to make thousands of decisions since Ive been President, serving in the Oval Office. And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process. I think Im a much wiser and more experienced man than I was when I debated 4 years ago against President Ford. Ive also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions. H. L. Mencken said that for every problem theres a simple answer. It would be neat and plausible  and wrong.  Mr. Stone, in my State of the Union address earlier this year, I pointed out that any threat to the stability or security of the Persian Gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country. In the past, weve not had an adequate military presence in that region. Now we have two major carrier task forces. We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region. And weve made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.  Well, there are various elements of defense. One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope well get to later on, because thats the most important single issue in this campaign. Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world. I think, habitually, Governor Reagan has advocated the injection of military forces into troubled areas, when I and my predecessors both Democrats and Republicans  have advocated resolving those troubles and those difficult areas of the world peacefully, diplomatically, and through negotiation.  Again its important to put the situation into perspective. In 1974 we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree. We had an even worse oil shock in 1979. In 1974 we had the worst recession, the deepest and most penetrating recession since the Second World War. The recession that resulted this time was the briefest weve had since the Second World War.  Yes. We have demanded that the American people sacrifice, and theyve done very well. As a matter of fact, were importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago. Weve had a 25-percent reduction since the first year I was in office. At the same time, as I said earlier, we have added about 9 million net new jobs in that period of time  a record never before achieved.  Governor Reagans proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public. He would actually have to cut Government spending by at least $130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal.  Thank you, Mr. Hilliard.  Ours is a nation of refugees, a nation of immigrants. Almost all of our citizens came here from other lands and now have hopes, which are being realized, for a better life, preserving their ethnic commitments, their family structures, their religious beliefs, preserving their relationships with their relatives in foreign countries, but still forming themselves together in a very coherent society, which gives our Nation its strength.  Well, its obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life. We have made good progress, and theres no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation, the minimum wage, welfare, national health insurance, those kinds of commitments that have typified the Democratic Party since ancient history in this countrys political life are a very important element of the future. In all those elements, Governor Reagan has repeatedly spoken out against them, which, to me, shows a very great insensitivity to giving deprived families a better chance in life. This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.  Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists. At one of the recent economic summit conferences between myself and the other leaders of the We. stern world, we committed ourselves to take strong action against terrorism. Airplane hijacking was one of the elements of that commitment. There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years, in recent months, additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.  We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war. We have no plans to sell additional materiel or goods to Iran that might be of a warlike nature. When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then and have consistently maintained since then that if the hostages are released safely, that we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns, which they have bought and paid for-also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released. Thats been a consistent policy, one I intend to carry out.  I didnt hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism in the future. What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights-commercial air flights  to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of airplanes, or the harboring of hijackers. Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office, not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives. Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities. And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israels right to exist and recognizes U.N. Resolution 242 as a basis for a Middle East peace.  Yes, Id be glad to. Inflation, unemployment, the cities-all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons. Every President who has served in the Oval Office since Harry Truman has been dedicated to the proposition of controlling nuclear weapons, to negotiate with the Soviet Union  balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry.  Yes. Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements. He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty  and I dont know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form  but he also advocates the possibility-he said its been a missing element-of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race and insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own Nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.  I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what were talking about.  I dont think theres any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up. What Ive had as a basic commitment since Ive been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil: It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy, to stop the waste of energy, and secondly, to produce more American energy.  Yes, sir. To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which well realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal  an unequaled record in the history of our country. Governor Reagan says that this is not a good achievement, and he blames restraints on coal production on regulations  regulations that affect the life and the health and safety of miners and also regulations that protect the purity of our air and the quality of our water and our land. We cannot cast aside those regulations. We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.  Sure. As a matter of fact, the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well known fact. Also, recently, when someone suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Act should be abolished, Governor Reagan responded, Amen.  As long as theres a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable social security system, free of the threat of bankruptcy. Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions he has advocated making social security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it. I noticed also in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making social security more sound by reducing the adjustments in social security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation. These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security and the well-being, and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.  Fine. These constant suggestions that the basic social security system should be changed does cause concern and consternation among the aged of our country. Its obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that social security benefits should not be taxed, and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which social security payments are made to the retired people. We also need to continue to index the social security payments so that if inflation rises, the social security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the social security check continue intact.  I think this debate on social security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation. These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this Nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.  Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question. [Laughter]  Yes. I mentioned the radical departure of Governor Reagan from the principles or ideals or historical perspective of his own party. I dont think this can be better illustrated than in the case with guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our Nation. For 40 years, the Republican Party platforms called for guaranteeing women equal rights with a constitutional amendment. Six predecessors of mine who served in the Oval Office called for this guarantee of womens rights. Governor Reagan and the new Republican Party has departed from this commitment  a very severe blow to the opportunity for women finally to correct discrimination under which they have suffered.  Yes. Howard, Im a southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region about an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system. One of the commitments that I made was to deregulate the major industries of this country. Weve been remarkably successful, with the help of the Democratic Congress. Weve deregulated the air industry, the rail industry, the trucking industry, financial institutions; now working on the communications industry.  First of all, Id like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible. I think its been a very constructive debate, and I hope its helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan. Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during this last few hours in my life. \"\"\",\"\"\" I dont know what the differences might be, because I dont know what Mr. Carters policies are. I do know what he has said about mine. And Im only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.  Mr. Stone, I have submitted an economic plan that Ive worked out in concert with a number of fine economists in this country, all of whom approve it, and believe that over a 5-year projection, this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture, that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983, if not earlier, and that we can afford-along with the cuts that I have proposed in Government spending  we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed  and probably, mainly because Mr. Carters economic policy has built into the next 5 years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more next year out of the peoples pockets than was taken this year. And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase. Im only reducing the amount of the increase.  Well, yes, I question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous administrations, in the preceding 8 years to this administration. I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those 8 years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace. I also would like to point out that Republican Presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both Houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.  Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country, that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore its uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious, and its dangerous to say this to the people. When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8 percent, as you said. It had been cut in two by President Gerald Ford. It is now running at 12.7 percent.  Well, most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform. I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in Government. As a matter of fact, one of the Secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it. Weve had the General Accounting Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.  Yes. The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same 4 years. The size of government increased only onesixth in California of what it increased in proportion to population in Georgia.  I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner-city areas, that in cooperation with local government and with National Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperation with the private sector, that we have development zones. Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area. And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.  I believe in it. I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that weve made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didnt even know it had a racial problem. I know those things can grow out of despair in an inner city, when theres hopelessness at home, lack of work, and so forth. But I believe that all of us together  and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was; its a bully pulpit  and I think that something can be done from there, because the goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us  ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be  that we will have total equal opportunity for all people. And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.  Yes. The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place. But as Governor, when I was at that end of the line and receiving some of these grants for Government programs, I saw that so many of them were dead-end. They were public employment for these people who really want to get out into the private job market, where there are jobs with a future.  Well, Barbara, youve asked that question twice. I think you ought to have at least one answer to it. [Laughter]  The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism  totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people. And weve been guilty of that. Because someone didnt meet exactly our standards of human rights, even though they were an ally of ours, instead of trying patiently to persuade them to change their ways, we have, in a number of instances, aided a revolutionary overthrow which results in complete totalitarianism, instead, for those people. And I think that this is a kind of a hypocritical policy when, at the same time, were maintaining a detente with the one nation in the world where there are no human rights at all  the Soviet Union.  Yes. I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind. And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President. I have never made the statement that he suggested about nuclear proliferation, and nuclear proliferation, or the trying to halt it, would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine.  Yes. I think Im right, because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy. And then, as we build up our national security, to restore our margin of safety, we at the same time try to restrain the Soviet buildup, which has been going forward at a rapid pace and for quite some time.  Yes, Id like to respond very much.  I know the Presidents supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what hes saying with what I have said or what my positions are. I sometimes think hes like the witch doctor that gets mad when a good doctor comes along with a cure thatll work.  Im not sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this Nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich. The coal that the President mentioned: Yes, we have it, and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now. The mines are closed down; there are 22,000 miners out of work. Most of this is due to regulations which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it. With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act. I think, as technology improves, well be able to do even better with that.  That is a misstatement, of course, of my position. I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than Government can. The Department of Energy has a multibillion-dollar budget, in excess of $10 billion. It hasnt produced a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy.  Yes. If it is a wellknown fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California  not a law, regulations that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations. It would have destroyed the economy of California, and, I must say, we had the support of Congress when pointed out how ridiculous this attempt was by the Environmental Protection Agency. We still have the strictest air control or air pollution laws in the country.  The social security system was based on a false premise, with regard to how fast the number of workers would increase and how fast the number of retirees would increase. It is actuarially out of balance, and this first became evident about 16 years ago, and some of us were voicing warnings then. Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our Nations history, the payroll tax increase for social security, which will only put a Band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most.  Well, that just isnt true. It has, as I said, delayed the actuarial imbalance falling on us for just a few years with that increase in taxes. And I dont believe we can go on increasing the tax, because the problem for the young people today is that theyre paying in far more than they can ever expect to get out.  There you go again. [Laughter]  Well, Barbara, I believe that there is a fundamental difference-and I think it has been evident in most of the answers that Mr. Carter has given tonight  that he seeks the solution to anything as another opportunity for a Federal Government program. I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers and autonomy and authority that belongs back at the State and local level  it has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people  and that there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.  Yes. Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands of unelected judges. I am for equal rights, and while you have been in office for 4 years, and not one single State  and most of them have a majority of Democratic legislators has added to the ratification or voted to ratify the equal rights amendment.  Well, my last word is again to say that we were talking about this very simple amendment and womens rights. And I make it plain again: I am for womens rights. But I would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that so-called simple amendment could be used by mischievous men to destroy discriminations that properly belong, by law, to women, respecting the physical differences between the two sexes, labor laws that protect them against doing things that would be physically harmful to them. Those could all be challenged by men. And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.  Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible. Im sorry that we couldnt persuade the bringing in of the third candidate, so that he could have been seen also in these debates. But still, its good that at least once, all three of us were heard by the people of this country. \"\"\",\"\"\" Thank you, Mrs. Hinerfeld.  Mr. Stone, do you have a followup question for the Governor?  The same question now goes to President Garter. President Carter, would you like to have the question repeated? THE PRESIDENT. Yes.

CLOSING STATEMENTS  Gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, for 60 years the League of Women Voters has been committed to citizen education and effective participation of Americans in governmental and political affairs. The most critical element of all in that process is an informed citizen who goes to the polls and who votes. \"\"\"\n",
      "September 21 1980,MR. ANDERSON,GOVERNOR REAGAN,\"\"\" fiscal restraint, I think is necessary. Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline. I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that. those imports have been reduced. And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30. In other words, weve had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers. Whereas I have proposed we ought to take. put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil. Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments. their Social Security tax payments by 50%. That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.MOYERS: Mr. Reagan. Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years supply of natural gas, 47 years supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and thats going to be enough. Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact. And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem. Even though its true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day. The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million. And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity. It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies. I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later. Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country. When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country - Continental United States Army Divisions - simply could not pass a readiness testMOYERS: Mr. Corddry? Mr. Moyers. I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money. We signed one bill. or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars. That is just a downpayment, in my opinion. But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile. Ive just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion. The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion. I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.MOYERS: Mr. Reagan? Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960. It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. Im happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question - to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasnt money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and weve told you where the money is coming from. Its going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco. That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities. In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.MOYERS: Mr. Reagan, your response. Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating? It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think its going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver. When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, weve seen what has happened. We havent gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we havent gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carters first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - thats about 18% on an annualized basis - what its going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it brutal economics. Ive been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what Im going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, its gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. Im going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that Ive talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.MOYERS: Ms. Quinn. Mr. Moyers, Im not here to debate Governor Reagans record as Governor. This is 1980 and not 1966. But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office. Spending, in other words. more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government. But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans. It doesnt accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor. In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military. And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up. Ms. Golden, certainly the church has the right to take a position on moral issues. But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned - that specific case - to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges - that only judges that hold a certain, quote, view, on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I dont believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I dont believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago. And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - its a very deeply personal matter. But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong. And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools. I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, Be sure to say a prayer before you start your days work. But I dont think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.MOYERS: Mr. Reagan. I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted. And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term. And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individuals conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties. I think youve seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing - we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft. We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts\"\"\",\"\"\" I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those. perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government. I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production. And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, youre causing inflation. And it isnt really higher prices, its just, you are reducing the value of the money. You are robbing the American people of their savings. And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings. ...and $500 billion over the next five.MOYERS: Mr. Anderson? Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline. It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that. And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then were asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers. But why? Why take it in the first place if youre going to give it back? Why not leave it with them? And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he. or 15 months ago, on what he believed in. Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country. Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself. Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and Im for it. But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all youre doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply. To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact. The fact is, that in todays oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used. But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground. And this is known oil reserves, known supplies. There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago. We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the worlds coal supply, good for centuries, in this country. I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production. We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest. the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible. All of these things can be done. When you stop and think that we are only drilling on 2%. have leased only 2% of the possible. possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis. That we are, indeed, an energy-rich nation. Well, as Ive said, I am not an enemy of conservation. I wouldnt be called a conservative if I were. But, when my figures are challenged, as the President himself challenged them after I made them, I think it should be called to the attention of John and the others here that my figures are the figures of the Department of Energy, which has not been overly optimistic in recent years as to how much supply we have left. That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years. As for saving energy and conserving, the American people havent been doing badly at that. Because in industry today, were producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973. And motorists are using 8% less than they were back at that time of the oil embargo. So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that. But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.MOYERS: Mr. Anderson. Mr. Corddry, its a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present. I. too, believe in the voluntary military. As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldnt have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees. I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work. Recognize that we have a voluntary military. We are asking for men and women to join the military as a career, and were asking them to deal with the most sophisticated of equipment. And a young man is out there on a $1 billion carrier in charge of the maintenance of a $20 million aircraft, working 100 hours a week at times, and hes earning less for himself and his family, while hes away from his family, than he could earn if he were in one of the most menial jobs, working 40 hours a week here at home. As an aid to enlistment. we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I. Bill of Rights - the fact that, by serving in the military, they could provide for a future college education. In 1977, we took that away from the military. That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up. So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if were going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heavens sakes, lets go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that were asking of them. Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate. We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instants notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment. Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people. The other day, I just - Ill hasten - I just saw one example. Down in Texas. I saw a high school that is military. Ill catch up with it later. Well, let me just say that, with regard to that same missile system, I happen to support and believe in the missile, itself. But thats not the $54 billion cost that John is talking about. Hes talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states. And first, he was going to dig a racetrack and have it going around in the racetrack so it would meet the requirements of SALT II treaty, and now hes decided itll have a straight up and down thing, so it can he both verifiable and yet hideable from the Soviet Union. We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault. But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly. And therefore, if I only had another second left, Id say that that high school class in a military training - 40 of its 80 graduates last year entered the United States service academies; West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy, and to see those young men made me very proud to realize that there are young people in this country that are prepared to go into that kind of a career in service of their country. I dont think Id have to go against that pledge. I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid. The mayors that Ive talked to in some of our leading cities tell! me that the Federal grants that come with. for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local governments hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority. If they had that money without those government restrictions, every one of them has told me they could make great savings and make far greater use of the money. What I have been advocating is, why dont we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs? Seventy-five percent of the people live in the cities. I dont know of a city in America that doesnt have the kind of problems youre talking about. But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them? New York is being taxed for money that will then go to Detroit. But Detroit is being taxed for money that, lets say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia. Wouldnt it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place? But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and Ive believed. I have talked of having zones in those cities that are run down, where there is a high percentage of people on welfare, and offer tax incentives. The government isnt getting a tax now from businesses there because they arent there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working. And why dont we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones? Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there. The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work. We could have an urban homestead act. Weve got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures. What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house. All have to do is agree to refurbish it, make it habitable, and live in it - just as 100 or more years ago, we did with the open land in this country - urban . or country homesteading.MOYERS: Mr. May? Yes. Government claims. John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from. It will come from the pockets of the people. It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas. And the problem is, with Governments - Federal, State and Local - taking $.44 out of every dollar earned, that the Federal Government has pre-empted too many of the tax sources, and that the cities. if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, its because the Federal Government has pre-empted. Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it. But the Federal Government doesnt make money. It just takes - from the people. And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem. Stand in the South Bronx as I did, in the spot where Jimmy Carter made his promise that he was going to, with multi-billion dollar programs, refurbish that area that looks like bombed-out London in World War II. I stood there, and I met the people. And I heard them ask just for something that would give them hope. And I believe that, while all of the promises have been broken, theyve never been carried out. But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.MOYERS: Mr. Anderson. Miss Quinn, I dont have to. Ive done it. We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures. And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committees projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated. And eliminated probably more quickly than our plan, but we wanted to be so conservative with it, that people would see how. how well it could be done. Now, Johns been in the Congress for 20 years. And John tells us that first, weve got to reduce spending before we can reduce taxes. Well, if youve got a kid thats extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance. Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker. But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs. Government always needs the money it gets. And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs. Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world. And that state we controlled spending. We cut the rate of increase in spending in half. But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion. I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned. And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending. And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment. We have considered inflation in our figures. We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative. I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and thats what hes counting on for his plan. But hes going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget. We believe that thats too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.MOYERS: Mr. Anderson. Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures. And John has just made up some very interesting figures. We took the Senate report, of course. But we did factor in our own ideas with regard to increases in the projected military spending that we believe would, over a period of time, do what is necessary. Now also, with regard to the figures about California. The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half. It at the John doesnt quite realize - hes never held an executive position of that kind. And I think being Governor of California is probably the closest thing to the Presidency, if thats possible, of any executive job in America today - because it is the most populous state. And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years. And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt. Oh, Im its my question. But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I dont think theres any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which weve abandoned so much in this country. Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival. For a belief that law must be based on a higher law. For a return to traditions and values that we once had. Our Government, in its most sacred documents - the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and all - speak of man being created, of a Creator. That were a nation under God. Now, I have thought for a long time that too many of our churches have been too reluctant to speak up in behalf of what they believe is proper in Government, and they have been too too lax in interfering, in recent years, with Governments invasion of the family itself, putting itself between parent and child. I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California. Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I wont take a position on that. But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader. Thats what elections are all about.MOYERS: Ms. Golden. The litmus test that John says is in the Republican platform, says no more than the judges to be appointed should have a respect for innocent life. Now, I dont think thats a bad idea. I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life. With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, theres one individual whos not being considered at all. Thats the one who is being aborted. And Ive noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born. I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being? I happen to believe it is.MOYERS: Mr. Anderson. Before beginning my closing remarks, here, I would just like to remark a concern that I have that we have criticized the failures of the Carter policy here rather considerably, both of us this evening. And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond. But I believe it would have been much more unfair to have had John Anderson denied the right to participate in this debate. And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement. Now, as to my closing remarks\"\"\",\"\"\" your time is up. Ms. Loomis? The next question goes to Mr. Reagan from Daniel Greenberg. I would like to say at this point that the candidates requested the same questions to be repeated, for the sake of precision, on the part of the interrogator. So, Mr. Greenberg, you may address Mr. Anderson. This question goes to you, Mr. Anderson, from Charles Corddry. Your time is up, Mr. Reagan.REAGAN: Fine.MOYERS: Im sorry. You can finish it after its over. Mr. Anderson? This question comes to you, Mr. Reagan, from my colleague, Lee May. Jane Bryant Quinn has the next question, for you, Mr. Anderson. Would would you have a comment, Mr. Reagan? Our final question comes from Soma Golden, and its directed to Mr. Reagan. Mr. Reagan you now have three minutes for closing remarks. Mr. Anderson, you have the final three minutes. Mr. Anderson, we, too, wish there were more time, and for all the limitations of the form - and there are other forms to try - the Chair, for one, would like to see such meetings become a regular and frequent part of every Presidential campaign. Mr. Reagan, Mr. Anderson, we thank you for coming, and thanks to our panelists, Carol Loomis, Daniel Greenberg, Charles Corddry, Lee May, Jane Bryant Quinn and Soma Golden. And thank you in the audience at home for joining us. This first Presidential Debate of 1980 has been brought to you as a public service by the League of Women Voters Education Fund. Im Bill Moyers. Good night.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 22 1976,MR. CARTER,THE PRESIDENT,\"\"\" Well, I might say first of all, that I think in case of a Carter administration, the sacrifices would be much less. Mr. Fords own environmental agency has projected a 10-percent unemployment rate by 1978 if be is President. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process, if they know that they will be helping to make decisions and wont be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that weve experienced ever since 1960 bas been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials. When youve got 7 1/2, 8 million people out of work, when youve got three times as much inflation as you had during the last 8-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history, when you have it becoming increasingly difficult for a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there is a natural inclination to be turned off. Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and Watergate and the CIA revelations, people have felt that theyve been betrayed by public officials. I dont have any response.THE MODERATOR. Thank you. In the last 2 weeks Ive had a chance to talk to two men who have visited the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and China. One is Governor Averell Harriman,1 who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other one is James Schlesinger,2 whom I think you accompanied to China. I got a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished gentlemen. No, I did not. Well, just briefly, I think this is the second time that General Brown has made a statement for which he did have to apologize--and I know that everybody makes mistakes. I think the first one was related to the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and in the Congress. This one concerned Great Britain. I think he said Israel was a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. I dont believe it does. I began campaigning 22 months ago. At that time nobody thought I had a chance to win. Very few people knew who I was. I came from a tiny town, as you know--Plains--and didnt hold public office, didnt have very much money. And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. Well, I might say I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right. This administrations record of environment is very bad. Yes, I would be glad to. In the first place, as is the case with the environmental policy and energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. Its impossible for mayors or Governors to cooperate with the President, because they cant anticipate what is going to happen next. The description just made of this administrations record is hard to recognize. I think it is accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the voting rights acts and against the civil rights acts in their debative stage. I think once it was assured they were going to pass, he finally voted for it. I would not work hard to support any of those. We have always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed but the passage of them has been fairly slow and few and far between. In the 200-year history, there has been a very cautious approach to this. Quite often we have a transient problem. I am strongly against abortion. I think abortion is wrong. I dont think the Government ought to do anything to encourage abortion, but I dont favor a constitutional amendment on the subject. But short of a constitutional amendment, and within the confines of a Supreme Court ruling, I will do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures. I personally dont believe that the Federal Government ought to finance abortions, but I draw the line and dont support a constitutional amendment. However, I honor the right of people to seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on prayer in the schools, and on abortion, but among those you named, I wont actively work for the passage of any of them. I think its accurate to say that Mr. Fords position on gun control has changed. Earlier, Mr. Levi, his Attorney General, put forward a gun control proposal which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused that called for the prohibition against the sale of the so-called Saturday night specials. It would have put very strict control over who owned a handgun. While I was Governor of Georgia, although I am not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system. We streamlined the structure of the courts, put in administrative offices, put a unified court system in, and required that all severe sentences be reviewed for uniformity; and, in addition to that, put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office--selection of all judges and district attorneys, prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit. Once the search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I am given a list of the 5 or 7 or 10 best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those persons. If the list was in my opinion fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic political philosophy, as best as I could determine it, which would be to continue the progress that has been made under the last two Courts--the Warren Court and the Burger Court. Well, with all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of making that statement because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression, caused by Herbert Hoover, and the time President Ford took office. We have got 7 1/2 million people out of jobs. Since he has been in office, 2? million more American people have lost their jobs. In the last 4 months alone, 500,000 Americans have gone on the unemployment rolls. In the last month, weve had a net loss of 163,000 jobs. Well, thats not exactly an accurate description of what happened. When I was that far ahead it was immediately following the Democratic Convention and before the Republican Convention. At that time 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford, but as occurred at the end of the Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself, and I think immediately following the Republican Convention there was about a 10-point spread. I believe that to be accurate. I had 49 percent; President Ford had 39 percent. The major purpose of an election for President is to choose a leader, someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country, to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficulties, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity.\"\"\",\"\"\" Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people in the next 4 years, under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace--which we have--which means, of course, that we will have to maintain an adequate military capability; which means, of course, that we will have to add, I think, a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate strategic forces, adequate conventional forces. No, Mr. Kraft. Were spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total Federal expenditure by the Federal Government at the present time, for human needs. Now, we will probably have to increase that to some extent, but we dont have to have growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation. I believe that the American people have been turned off in this election, Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons. We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, a great many allegations of wrongdoing, of alleged immorality. Those are very disturbing to the American people. They wonder how an elected representative can serve them and participate in such activities, serving in the Congress of the United States. Yes, and Im certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very bad period of time in American political history. Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam. Mr. Nelson, I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked. And the testimony, under oath, was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House. I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people. Thats for the proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision. I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question thats been asked me by any Senator or any Member of the House, plus the fact that the Special Prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the Attorney General, on his initiation--the highest law enforcement official in this country-all of them have given me a clean bill of health. And Ive told everything I know about it. I think the matter is settled once and for all. Well, I firmly believe, Mr. Kraft, that its unwise for a President to signal in advance what options he might exercise if any international problem arose. I have indicated to General Brown that the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case, and in several others were very ill-advised. And General Brown has indicated his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, in this situation, settle the matter. The Governor may not have heard my established criteria for the selection of a Vice President, but it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be President of the United States. And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified--16 years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, very high responsibilities on important committees. Thats a tribute to their interest in this election. First, let me set the record straight. I vetoed the strip mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip mining bill would have meant the loss of literally thousands of jobs, something around 140,000 jobs. Number two, that strip mining bill would have severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the Arab oil supplies. So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would have interfered with our energy independence program. Let me speak out very strongly. The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help our major metropolitan areas. I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with, a general revenue sharing program whereby cities and States--the cities, two-thirds, and the States, one-third--get over $6 billion a year, in cash, with which they can provide many, many services, whatever they really want. Well, let me say at the outset, I am very proud of the record of this administration. In the Cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the Secretary of Transportation--Bill Coleman. You are familiar, I am sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to General James. And there was just approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy. So, we are giving full recognition to individuals, of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility. I support the Republican platform which calls for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortions. I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the States the individual right of the voters in those States the chance to make a decision by public referendum. I call that the peoples amendment. I think if you really believe that the people of a State ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind, that we ought to have a Federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the 50 States to make the choice. Mr. Maynard, the record of gun control, whether its in one city or another or in some States does not show that the registration of a gun, handgun, or the registration of the gun owner has in any way whatsoever decreased the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime. The record just doesnt prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. Yes, I have, and the individuals with whom I have consulted have not convinced me that a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you are talking about. The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether its registered or outlawed-they will be obtained--and they are the people who ought to go behind bars. You should not, in the process, penalize the legitimate handgun owner. And when you go through the process of registration, you, in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.THE MODERATOR. Governor Carter. I think the answer as to the kind of person that I would select is obvious. I had one opportunity to nominate an individual to the Supreme Court, and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, John Paul Stevens. I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals judge. And I was very pleased that an overwhelmingly Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming. Well, Mr. Kraft, I violently disagree with your assessment, and I dont think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to. Let me talk about the economic announcements that were made just this past week. Mr. Kraft, I think the record can be put in this way, which is the way that I think satisfies most Americans: Since the depths of the recession, we have added 4 million jobs. Most importantly, consumer confidence, as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan, is at the highest since 1972. I think the increase in the prospects as far as I am concerned and the less favorable prospects for Governor Carter reflect that Governor Carter is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions. Just a moment ago, for example, he was indicating that in the 1950s, for example, unemployment was very low. He fails to point out that in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam--I mean in Korea. We had 3,500,000 young men in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. Thats not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment. For 25 years, I served in the Congress under five Presidents. I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions. I didnt always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican Presidents. For the last 2 years, Ive been the President, and I have found from experience that its much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second guess them.\"\"\",\"\"\"\"\"\"\n",
      "October 6 1976,MR. CARTER,THE PRESIDENT,\"\"\" Well, I think this Republican administration has been almost all style and spectacular and not substance. Weve got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future. In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed. And I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reason for those failures. Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement thats not true. I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy; that would, obviously, be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be President of the country. I think that this is an instance for deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense. As a matter of fact, Ive never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget. As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget. Well, Im not going to name my Cabinet before I get elected; Ive got a little ways to go before I start doing that. But I have an adequate background, I believe. I am a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, the first military graduate since Eisenhower. Ive served as Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries--in South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East, and in Japan. First of all, I would quit conducting the decisionmaking process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford. In many instances weve made agreements, like in Vietnam, that have been revealed later on to our embarrassment. Well, in the first place, I am not criticizing His Holiness the Pope. I was talking about Mr. Ford. I would never single out food as a trade embargo item. If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment. For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our Nation on oil, I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war. And I would respond instantly and in kind. I would not ship that Arab country anything--no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing. I wouldnt single out just food. If--Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, its a Moslem country. But if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war. And I would make sure that the Saudis understood this ahead of time, so there would be no doubt in their mind. I think under those circumstances, they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with the previous oil embargo.THE MODERATOR. President Ford. Id like to go back just one moment to the previous question, where Mr. Ford, I think, confused the issue by trying to say that were shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid. As a matter of fact, during this current year, we are shipping Iran--or have contracted to ship to Iran--about $7? billion worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia about $7? billion worth of arms. Well, always in the past we have had an ability to have a strong defense and also to have a strong domestic economy and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations. These characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford. We are no longer respected. In a showdown vote in the United Nations or in any other international council we are lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us. Our allies feel that weve neglected them. The so-called Nixon shocks against Japan have weakened our relationships there. Under this administration we have also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts. Let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam war, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon. The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent. The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent--out-third what it is under this administration. So, we did have at that time, with good management, the ability to do both. I dont think anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world. Well, Mr. Ford acts like he is running for President for the first time. He has been in office 2 years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement. He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently. No, its not just campaign rhetoric. I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on Earth. I think weve got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat. But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles; as far as strength derived from the unity within our country; as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the Secretary of State, the President, sharing in the evolution and carrying out of a foreign policy; as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate, and we will give them adequate attention; as far as strength derived from doing what is right, caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world--in those respects we are not strong. Also, we will never be strong again overseas unless we are strong at home. And with our economy in such terrible disarray, and getting worse by the month--we have got 500,000 more Americans unemployed today than we had 3 months ago; we have got 2 1/2 million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office--this kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world. I noticed that Mr. Ford didnt comment on the prisons in Chile. This is a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship. This has not been an ancient history story. Last year, under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile. Well, here again, the Panamanian question is one that has been confused by Mr. Ford. He had directed his diplomatic representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time. When Mr. Reagan raised this question in Florida, Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word detente. Well, I am reluctant to comment on the recent report. I havent read it. I think the American people have only one requirement--that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely. I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries, because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company, is an absolute disgrace. This is the first time that I remember in the history of our country when weve let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights. I will do everything I can as President to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries. One of the most embarrassing failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a Presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars. This is what the families of MIAs want. So far, Mr. Ford has not done it. We have had several fragmentary efforts by Members of the Congress and by private citizens.\"\"\",\"\"\" Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities. Let me take just one question that he raises--the military strength and capability of the United States. Governor Carter, in November of 1975, indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion. A few months later he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by $8 billion or $9 billion. And more recently he talks about cutting the defense budget by $5 billion to $7 billion. There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kinds of reductions in our military appropriations. I dont believe we should move to a cold war relationship. I think its in the best interest of the United States and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold war relationship with the Soviet Union. Governor Carter again contradicts himself. He complains about secrecy, and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East, that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union--I presume for the purpose of imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations. I believe that we have negotiated with the Soviet Union since Ive been President from a position of strength. And let me cite several examples. I dont believe, Mr. Frankel, that the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I dont believe that the Romanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. I dont believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union. Each of those countries is independent, autonomous; it has its own territorial integrity. And the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union. As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia, and Romania, to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the President of the United States and the people of the United States are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy, and their freedom. Governor Carter apparently doesnt realize that since Ive been President, we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware. We have made available to the Israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of Israel 27 years ago. So, the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and were dedicated to the survival and security of Israel. Our relationship with the Peoples Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai communiquf 1972. That communiqualls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the Peoples Republic. It doesnt set a time schedule; it doesnt make a determination as to how that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government. The Shanghai communiquoes say that the differences between the Peoples Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means. There is no policy of this Government to give to the Peoples Republic, or to sell to the Peoples Republic of China, military equipment. I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give, or otherwise transfer military hardware to the Peoples Republic of China or any other Communist nations, such as the Soviet Union and the like.THE MODERATOR. Governor Carter. Let me say very categorically, you cannot maintain the security and the strength of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated. In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion. He is now down to a figure of $5 billion to $7 billion. Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace. First, we have to understand that SALT I expires October 3, 1977. Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial steps so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to 1985. As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a 2,400 limitation on launchers of ballistic missiles. That would mean a cutback in the Soviet program. It would not interfere with our .own program. At the same time we put a limitation of 1,320 on MIRVs. I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum--from air, from the sea, or from the land--can be included within a SALT II agreement. They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed. At the same time we have to make certain that the Soviet Unions Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of an agreement which is in the best interests of both countries. Governor Carter brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time. I must remind him that we are at peace, and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war. I believe that our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality, and the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next 4 years. I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another--and the United States must not spread itself too thinly; that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam--but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences. The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal. The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal, and the United States will maintain our national security interests in the Panama Canal. The White House did not prevent the release of that report. On July 12 of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report. I was very disappointed in the fact that the GAO released that report because I think it interjected political, partisan politics at the present time. Again, Governor Carter is inaccurate. The Arab boycott action was first taken in 1952. And in November of 1975, I was the first President to order the executive branch to take action--affirmative action through the Department of Commerce and other Cabinet Departments--to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott. Let me restate our policy. As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations. If they do give us a bona fide, complete accounting of the 800 MIAs, then I believe that the United States should begin negotiations for the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations, but not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.THE MODERATOR. Governor Carter? As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues. We can debate methods; we can debate one decision or another. But there are two things which cannot be debated---experience and results.\"\"\",\"\"\"\"\"\"\n",
      "September 23 1976,MR. CARTER,THE PRESIDENT,\"\"\" Yes. First of all its to recognize the tremendous economic strength of this country and to set the putting back to work of our people as a top priority. This is an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of business, agriculture, industry, labor, and government at all levels to work on this project. We will never have an end to the inflationary spiral, and we will never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.  Well, we now have such a low utilization of our productive capacity, about 73 percent-I think its about the lowest since the Great Depression years-and such a high unemployment rate now-7.9 percent-that we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures. And I think this would be easy to accomplish, to get jobs now without having the strong inflationary pressures that would be necessary.  Well, Mr. Ford is changing considerably his previous philosophy. The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country. Its just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, 25 percent of the total tax deductions go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country.  Well, as a matter of fact, there is. If we assume a rate of growth of our economy equivalent to what it was during President Johnson and President Kennedy, even before the Vietnamese war, and if we assume that, at the end of the 4-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 percent. Under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the allotment of money to finance programs increasing as the inflation rate does, my economic projects, I think confirmed by the House and the Senate committees, have been, with a $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year 81-which would be the last year of this next term-within that $60 billion increase, there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. I might say, too, that if we see that these goals cannot be reached-and I believe they are reasonable goals-then I would cut back on the rate of implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81, which is the last year of the next term.  Well, the assumption that you have described thats different is in the rate of growth of our economy.  I believe that its accurate to say that the committees to whom you refer, with the employment rate that you state and with the 5 to 5 1/2 percent growth rate in our economy, that the projections would be a $60 billion increase in the amount of money that we have to spend in 1981 compared to now.  Well, I think its very difficult for President Ford to explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws. As a matter of fact now, I dont advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon. There is a difference, in my opinion, and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and in accordance with the definition in the dictionary.  Well, Ive been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the Governor of Georgia. When I took over we had a bureaucratic mess like we have in Washington now. And we had 300 agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions-some fully budgeted, some not-but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those 300 agencies and so forth down substantially; we eliminated 278 of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administered fairly, and it was a tremendous success. It hasnt been undone since I was there.  I cant say for sure that we would have fewer Federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in. It took me about 3 years to completely reorganize the Georgia government. The last year I was in office our budget was actually less than it was a year before, which showed a great improvement.  Well, Mr. Ford takes the same attitude that the Republicans always take. In the last 3 months before an election, they are always for the programs that they fight the other 3 1/2 years. I remember when Herbert Hoover was against jobs for people. I remember when All Landon was against social security. And later President Nixon-16 years ago-was telling the public that John Kennedys proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.  Well, among my other experiences in the past Ive been a nuclear engineer, and I did graduate work in this field. I think I know the capabilities and limitations of atomic power.  Yes, I would. Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies. We now encourage people to waste electricity by giving the lowest rates to the biggest users. We dont do anything to cut down on peak load requirements. We dont have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles. And whenever the automobile manufacturers come forward and say they cant meet the limits that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.  Well, Mr. Ford doesnt seem to put into perspective the fact that when 500,000 more people are out of work then there were 3 months ago, where we have 2 million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.  Now we have such a grossly unbalanced tax system, as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace. Of all the tax benefits now, 25 percent of them go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country. Over 50 percent-53 to be exact-percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country.  No, I wouldnt do away with all business deductions. I think that would be a very serious mistake. But if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone. I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living or who are presently required to list all their income.  Well, its not a matter of Republican and Democrat; its a matter of leadership or no leadership. President Eisenhower worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader, at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well.  What I have said is that the President ought to have a chance to appoint the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to have a coterminus term; in other words, both of them serve the same 4 years.  Well, one of the very serious things thats happened in our Government in recent years and has continued up until now is a breakdown in the trust among our people in the [ At this point, there was an audio failure which caused a delay in the debate until 11:18 p.m.]  There has been too much Government secrecy and not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.  Well, tonight, weve bad a chance to talk a lot about the past, but I think it is time to talk about the future. Our Nation in the last 8 years has been divided as never before. Its a time for unity. It is time to draw ourselves together, to have a President and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own Government. It is time for Government, industry and labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And its a time for Government to understand and to cooperate with our people. \"\"\",\"\"\" I dont believe that Mr. Carter has been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances. I notice particularly that he didnt endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. That legislation allegedly would help our unemployment, but we all know that it would have controlled our economy. It would have added $10 to $30 billion each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government. It would have called for export controls on agricultural products.  At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut-three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business-I said at the same time that we had to hold the lid on Federal spending; that for every dollar of a tax reduction, we had to have an equal reduction in Federal expenditures-a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of $395 billion, and that would have permitted us to have a $28 billion tax reduction.  That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established. I think the Congress should have added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from $750 to $1,000. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress and the Congress as a whole had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. I am sure you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, they have added about $17 billion in more spending by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So, I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on Federal spending.  If it is true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break, a tax reduction of that magnitude. I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief. I dont think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.  The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and military deserters the opportunity to earn their good record back. About 14 to 15,000 did take advantage of that program. We gave them ample time. I am against an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.  Well, Mr. Carter has indicated that he would give a blanket pardon to all draft evaders. I do not agree with that point of view. I gave in September of 1974 an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship. I think we gave them a good opportunity. I dont think we should go any further. THE MODERATOR.. Governor Carter.  I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that the Bureau of Census-we checked it just yesterday-indicates that in the 4 years that Governor Carter was Governor of the State of Georgia, expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent. Employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent. And the figures also show that the bonded indebtedness of the State of Georgia during his Governorship went up over 20 percent.  Well, in the last 2 years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time. We were faced with heavy inflation-over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment. But in the last 24 months weve turned the economy around, and weve brought inflation down to under 6 percent. And we have added employment of about 4 million in the last 17 months to the point where we have 88 million people working in America today, the most in the history of the country. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts, and I think we will have some decrease in our disbursements. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.  We feel that with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality of life area, we can still have a balanced budget, which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978. We wont wait 1 year or 2 years longer, as Governor Carter indicates.  Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject. In January of 1975, I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any President. It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States. It called for conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.  The bills that Ive vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems. Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than 400,000 jobs would be made available. Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about 150 to 200,000 jobs would be made available. Each one of those jobs would have cost the taxpayer $25,000. In addition, the jobs would not be available right now; they would not have materialized for about 9 to 18 months.  Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight. But that is an extra $4 billion that would add to the deficit, which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector, not make jobs where the jobs really are. These make-work, temporary jobs, dead end as they are, are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.  Governor Carters answer tonight does not coincide with the answer that he gave in an interview to the Associated Press a week or so ago. In that interview Governor Carter indicated that he would raise the taxes on those in the medium- or middle-income brackets or higher. Now, if you take the medium- or middle-income taxpayer-thats about $14,000 per person-Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview, that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.  There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country but I think the feeling is misplaced. In the 2 years we have restored integrity in the White House and we have set high standards in the executive branch of the Government.  Well, it seems to me that we have a chance, the Republicans, to get a majority in the House of Representatives. We will make some gains in the United States Senate. So there will be different ratios in the House as well as in the Senate, and as President I will be able to work with that Congress.  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent. Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations. As a result, in the last 2 years we have had a responsible monetary policy.  You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first President in 30 years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the Federal Government-the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the others. Weve done that by Executive order. And I think weve tightened it up; weve straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years. It doesnt seem to me that its needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.  On November 2 all of you will make a very, very important decision. One of the major issues in this campaign is trust. A President should never promise more than he can deliver, and a President should always deliver everything that he has promised. A President cant be all things to all people. A President should be the same thing to all people. \"\"\",\"\"\"\"\"\"\n",
      "October 21 1960,MR. KENNEDY,MR. NIXON,\"\"\" Good evening, Mr. Howe. Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President. First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I voted for the Formosa resolution in 1955. I have sustained it since then. Ive said that I agree with the Administration policy. Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores. I indicated that I would defend those islands if the attack were directed against Pescadores and Formosa, which is part of the Eisenhower policy. Ive supported that policy. In the last week, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have re-read the testimony of General Twining representing the Administration in 1959, and the Assistant Secretary of State before the Foreign Relations Committee in 1958, and I have accurately described the Administration policy, and I support it wholeheartedly. So that really isnt an issue in this campaign. It isnt an issue with Mr. Nixon, who now says that he also supports the Eisenhower policy. Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign. The question is Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed. He surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arms and resources for Castro came from the United States, flowed out of Florida and other parts of the United States to Castro in the mountains. There isnt any doubt about that, number one. Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral. They have to include the other countries of Latin America. The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cubas economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe. If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro. Thats the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others. Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America. The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia. Were going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if were going to prevent Castros influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America. His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine. His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America. You yourself said, Mr. Vice President, a month ago, that if we had provided the kind of economic aid five years ago that we are now providing we might never have had Castro. Why didnt we? Mr. Edwards, I dont think its a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed. This is a decision that the president of the United States must make. The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948. This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States. There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state. Ive made no judgment about who should be secretary of state. I think that judgment could be made after election, if Im successful. The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power. The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs. Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state. Ive been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs. Im asking the peoples support as president. We will select the best man we can get. But Ive not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate. I really dont need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen. Ive served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service. Ive just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion. What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country. Now I didnt make most of the statements that you said I made. The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space. We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but were ahead of you in color television in your famous discussion in the kitchen. I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust. Secondly, I didnt say we had the worst slums in the world. I said we had too many slums. And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed. I didnt say we had the worst education in the world. What I said was that ten years ago, we were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today theyre producing twice as many as we are, and that this affects our security around the world. And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago. Part of that is because weve stood still here at home, because we havent met our problems in the United States, because we havent had a moving economy. Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space. Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science. Were first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, were not first. Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one. I think we should go back to Geneva, whos ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again. If we fail then, if were unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers. Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology theres some indications that by the time the next presidents term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war. So one more effort should be made. I dont think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere. They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space. But I believe the effort should be made once more by whos ever elected president of the United States. If we fail, its been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race. I hope we can succeed. But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then well have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground. I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it. There may be testing in outer space. I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere. Its possible to detect those kind of tests. The kind of tests which you cant detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space. So that Im hopeful we can try once more. If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves. But Im most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons. China may have it by 1963, Egypt. War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that were going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years. We ought to make one last effort. Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before hed go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement. He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament. He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin. The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous. I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing. In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States. The Soviet Union does understand strength. We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago. If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - its important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that were building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that were determined to protect our commitment. And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world. But until were strong here, until were moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful. I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting. I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May. One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe. Ive been critical of the Administrations failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution. We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily. But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union. I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties. We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate. We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didnt pass the House. I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union. Secondly, the relations between Russia and China. They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest. No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully. If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world. Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world. India started from about the same place that China did. Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years. India under a free society has been making some progress. But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she cant make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system. Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free. This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe. Its expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe. They want to be free. And my judgment is that they dont want to give their freedom up to become Communists. They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists. And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom. We can make it move. We can put the Communists on the defensive. Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955. The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands. Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed. The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw. I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Im very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands. General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States. The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish. Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible. Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw. Because he will not withdraw, because hes committed to these islands, because weve been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position. And therefore, the Presidents judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa. I support that. In view of the difficulties weve had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes weve had with Chiang Kai-shek, thats the only position we can take. Thats not the position you took, however. The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands. Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands. And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-sheks withdrawal from these islands.MR. HOWE: Under the agreed And thats the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight. I uh - said that Ive served this country for fourteen years. I served it uh - in the war. Im devoted to it. If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country. But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that its going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society. My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and its also stood still around the world. Uh - Were using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today. We had a recession in fifty-eight. We had a recession in fifty-four. Were not moving ahead in education the way we should. We didnt make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important. If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who dont recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence. And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business. And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language. Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have. Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them. If that were true, why didnt we identify ourselves with the people of Africa? Why didnt we bring students over here? Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt? That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government. I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has. It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest. And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead. I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still. We can no longer afford to be second best. I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that were on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that theyre going to put this country back to work again. I dont believe that there is anything this country cannot do. I dont believe theres any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom. And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny. And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.\"\"\",\"\"\" Good evening, Mr. Howe. Mr. Howe, Senator Kennedy, my fellow Americans. Since this campaign began I have had a very rare privilege. I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about. There is one issue that stands out above all the rest, one in which every American is concerned, regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live. And that issue, very simply stated, is this Our policies are very different. I think that Senator Kennedys policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that hes made during the course of this campaign. In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista. Now lets just see what this means. We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise. The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another. Now I dont know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without. But I do know this Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so. So that is my answer to this question. If you dont mind, Id like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question. Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America. I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars. We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and Id also like to point this out Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright. Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply arent as stated. First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik. Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public. Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that weve been hearing about what about American prestige abroadMR. HOWE: Comment, Senator Kennedy? Yes. I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months. As a matter of fact, theres been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating. Ive reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering. Ive reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating. I dont think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster. There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out. But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue. I think its time for them to fish or cut bait. I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year. Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and its rather difficult to be much more specific than that. Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference. This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level. By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved. Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation. I dont believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points. Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position. But lets look at the other side of the coin. If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isnt going to get his way - wed set back the cause of peace. We do not help it. We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit. I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have. And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is. When I say phony spirit, I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesnt intend to carry out what they say. Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out. I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be. First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his. Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union. And yet lets just see what weve done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland. This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them. In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union. Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course dont have as much time as Senator Kennedy had. I would just like to s- add this one point. If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America dont want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States. We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because were simply trying to save our own skins, not because were simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny. If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won. I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error. He says he supports the Presidents position. He says that he voted for the resolution. Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands. But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa. He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made. He repeated it again in a television debate that we had. Now, my point is this Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still. America is not standing still. It has not been standing still. And lets set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say. He talks about housing. We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration. We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration. Lets talk about civil rights. More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before. He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like. We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one. Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasnt been traveling in America. Hes been in some other country. Lets get that straight right away. Now the second point we have to understand is this, however. America has not been standing still. But America cannot stand pat. We cant stand pat for the reason that were in a race, as Ive indicated. We cant stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves. It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world. And this means more than what weve been doing. It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is. It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has. It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best. Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one. We had a good neighbor policy, yes. It sounded fine. But lets look at it. There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America. There are only three left. Lets look at Africa. Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration. Not one of them selected a Communist government. All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government. Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull? Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia? Of course not. What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of historys on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because were on the right side. Were on the side of freedom. Were on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice. But we arent going to move America forward and we arent going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements. Because we are first in the world in space, as Ive indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and were going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead. One other point I would make\"\"\",\"\"\" And good evening, Senator Kennedy. Now let me read the rules and conditions under which the candidates themselves have agreed to proceed. As they did in their first meeting, both men will make opening statements of about eight minutes each and closing statements of equal time running three to five minutes each. During the half hour between the opening and closing statements, the candidates will answer and comment upon questions from a panel of four correspondents chosen by the nationwide networks that carry the program. Each candidate will be questioned in turn with opportunity for comment by the other. Each answer will be limited to two and one-half minutes, each comment to one and one-half minutes. The correspondents are free to ask any questions they choose in the field of foreign affairs. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked. Time alone will determine the final question. Reversing the order in their first meeting, Senator Kennedy will make the second opening statement and the first closing statement. For the first opening statement, here is Vice President Nixon. Now the opening statement of Senator Kennedy. That completes the opening statements. Now the candidates will answer and comment upon questions put by these four correspondents John Edwards has his first question for Senator Kennedy. Mr. Vice President, do you have a comment? Walter Cronkite, you have your first question for Vice President Nixon. John Chancellor, your first question for Senator Kennedy. Any comment, Mr. Vice President? Our second round of questions begins with one from Mr. Edwards for the Vice President. Any comments, Senator Kennedy? We have time for only one or two more questions before the closing statements. Now Walter Cronkites question for Senator Kennedy. Your comment, Mr. Vice President? John Chancellors question for Vice President Nixon. Senator Kennedy, your comment. Under the agreed rules, gentlemen, weve exhausted the time for questions. Each candidate will now have four minutes and thirty seconds for his closing statement. Senator Kennedy will make the first final closing statement. Now, Vice President Nixon, your closing statement. Thank you gentlemen. Both candidates have asked me to express their thanks to the networks for this opportunity to appear on this discussion. May I repeat that all those concerned in tonights discussion have, sometimes reluctantly, followed the rules and conditions read at the outset and agreed to in advance by the candidates and the networks. The opening statements ran eight minutes each. The closing statements ran four minutes, thirty seconds. The order of speaking was reversed from their first joint appearance, when they followed the same procedure. A panel of newsmen questioned each candidate alternately. Each had two and a half minutes to reply. The other had a minute and a half to comment. But the first discussion dealt only with domestic policy. This one dealt only with foreign policy. One last word. As members of a new political generation, Vice President Nixon and Senator Kennedy have used new means of communication to pioneer a new type of political debate. The character and courage with which these two men have spoken sets a high standard for generations to come. Surely, they have set a new precedent. Perhaps they have established a new tradition. This is Quincy Howe. Good night from New York.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 13 1960,MR. KENNEDY,MR. NIXON,\"\"\" Good evening, Mr. Shadel. Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II. That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; its been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO. Ive stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin. It is a commitment that we have to meet if were going to protect the security of Western Europe. And therefore on this question I dont think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; Im sure there isnt any doubt in the mind of the Russians. We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin. Yes. The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island. The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China. Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu. Now, that is the issue. I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa. I support it and the Pescadores Island. That is the present American position. The treaty does not include these two islands. Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked. I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if theres any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty. Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if theres a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa. Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American. The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area. They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five. We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them. This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where. Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces. Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately. Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether its possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I dont feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe its been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war. I dont think its possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did. In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said Well, I must say that uh - Mr. Truman has uh - his methods of expressing things; hes been in politics for fifty years; hes been president of the United States. They may - are not my style. But I really dont think theres anything that I could say to President Truman thats going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner. Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I dont think I can. Ill just have to tell Mr. Morton that. If youd pass that message on to him. Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, American boys into Indochina. The reason Indochina was preserved was the result of the Geneva Conference which Indochina. Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights. I thought the. U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however. I never suggested espionage should stop. It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides. Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth. Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu. Thats not the position hes taking. Hes indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom. He didnt take that position on Tibet. He didnt take that position on Budapest. He doesnt take that position that Ive seen so far in Laos. Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba. I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh - Formosa and the Pescadores. But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and hes been supported by most military authority, these islands that were now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment. And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself. Hes extending the Administrations commitment. Well the que- the - Mr. Griffin, I believe, who is the head of the Klan, who lives in Tampa, Florida, indicated a - in a statement, I think, two or three weeks ago that he was not going to vote for me, and that he was going to vote for Mr. Nixon. I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan. Thats absurd. I dont suggest that, I dont support it. I would disagree with it. Mr. Nixon knows very well that in this - in this whole matter thats been involved with the so-called religious discussion in this campaign, Ive never suggested, even by the vaguest implication, that he did anything but disapprove it. And thats my view now. I disapprove of the issue. I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.MR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President. Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when theyre stated by the Vice President. I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. Im opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I dont know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. Im talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the presidents course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committees powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if theres a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didnt happen. Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress. The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War. On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that its my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Bensons program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. Weve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. Third, I think its possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, wed spend more money on housing, wed spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention. Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh - is of course his right, but the fact of the matter isMR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President? Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent. Thats untrue. The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. And I believe when the average hour for many farmers wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, were going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The Democratic platform and others say five per cent. Many say four and a half per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent. Thats why we dont have full employment today. Uh - Mr. McGee, there are about a hundred and four commodities that have some kind of depletion allowance - different kind of minerals, including oil. I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay. That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation. We want to be sure its fair and equitable. It includes oil abroad. Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home. Now the oil industry recently has had hard times. Particularly some of the smaller producers. Theyre moving about eight or nine days in Texas. But I can assure you that if Im elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully. And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent. I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.MR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President. Just to uh - correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine. What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there arent loopholes. If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesnt want to go into it. Now on the question of gold. The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies. In other words, if were going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy. We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade. We have to be able to compete in the world market. We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if were going to be able to meet our obligations. In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage. Now there isnt a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods. I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead. We have to be sure to maintain that. We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now weve maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own. Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige. And the significance of prestige, really, is because were so identified with the cause of freedom. Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh - who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, theyll be persuaded to follow our example. There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was. Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately. He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement. And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States. Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours. Mr. Dulles has suggested its from two to three times as great as ours. This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources. Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily. And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970. Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa. Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us. A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us. On the neutralists resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened. The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh - within Brazil. There are many indications. Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself. Laos is moving in that direction. So I would say our prestige is not so high. No longer do we give the image of being on the rise. No longer do we give an image of vitality.MR. SHADEL: Mr. Vice President.\"\"\",\"\"\" Good evening, Mr. Shadel. Yes. As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans. I resent that comment. I resent it because th- its an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war. I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years. I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war. There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war. I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party. But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record. We had a war when we came into power in 1953. We got rid of that; weve kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesnt indicate that were trigger-happy. Weve been strong, but we havent been trigger-happy. As far as Berlin is concerned, there isnt any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isnt any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin. Mr. Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack. I will say this Yes. I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. There isnt any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also lets have in mind this Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended. There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I dont think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa. Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa. What do we do then? My point is thisMR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy. Yes, I think so. Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Trumans ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject. I just do want to say one thing, however. We all have tempers; I have one; Im sure Senator Kennedy has one. But when a mans president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public. One thing Ive noted as Ive traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates. I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States. I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too. It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to. And I can only say that Im very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States. And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say Well, Mr. Cater, of course its a criticism that uh - is being made. Uh - I obviously dont think its valid. I have supported the Administrations position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct. As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination. Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the Presidents position throughout. I think the President was correct in ordering these flights. I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on. I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldnt have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here. And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time. The answer is that the United States cant afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag. Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu. What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands. Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which Ive referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position. Now, why did they reject it? For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that youre going to surrender an area thats free. Why? Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.MR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy? Well I welcome this opportunity to join Senator Kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this largest television audience in history something that I have been saying in the past and want to - will always say in the future. On our last television debate, I pointed out that it was my position that Americans must choose the best man that either party could produce. We cant settle for anything but the best. And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce. And that means that we cant have any test of religion. We cant have any test of race. It must be a test of a man. Also as far as religion is concerned. I have seen Communism abroad. I see what it does. Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together. We must not be divided on this issue. The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues. I obviously repudiate the Klan; I repudiate anybody who uses the religious issue; I will not tolerate it, I have ordered all of my people to have nothing to do with it and I say - say to this great audience, whoever may be listening, remember, if you believe in America, if you want America to set the right example to the world, that we cannot have religious or racial prejudice. We cannot have it in our hearts. But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign. Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week. Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate. Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes. Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point. He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want. I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. One last point I should make. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration. We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. And I only want to say that however good the record is, its got to be better. Because in this critical year - period of the sixties weve got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when were in the terrible competition were in with the Soviets.MR. SHADEL: Senator, your comment. Senator Kennedy has indicated on several occasions in this program tonight that I have been misstating his record and his figures. I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct. Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of here-it-is-and-here-it-isnt. Uh - On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isnt a problem because its from Social Security. But Social Security is a tax. The people pay it. It comes right out of your paycheck. This doesnt mean that the people arent going to be paying the bill. He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours. Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the - America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time. And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay. Now are we going to have that when it isnt going to help the farmers? I dont think we should have that kind of a program. Then he goes on to say that hes going to change the interest-rate situation and were going to get some more money that way. Well, what he is saying there in effect, were going to have inflation. Were going to go right back to what we had under Mr. Truman when he had political control of the Federal Reserve Board. I dont believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate. Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country. Im not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when were in the kind of a race were in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly. Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isnt good enough. Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want. Weve got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America. Its going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle. Now, what do we do about it? And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy. In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth. I refer, for example, to distressed areas. We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately. Thats why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, its for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need. And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth. Now what all this, of course, adds up to is thisMR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedys position and mine completely different on this. I favor the present depletion allowance. I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich. Why do we have a depletion allowance? Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. If we didnt have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senators. And its because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them. And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. One other thing. He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account. He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so youre not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated. But I oppose it. I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned. I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less. Well, Mr. Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar. That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out. Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports. And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce. This one must be stepped up. Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect. I think we have been right in carrying it. I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance. But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that weve aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely. They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad. Thats why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America. The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself. We can a big share of it, but weve got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.MR. SHADEL: Senator Kennedy. Well, I would say first of all that Senators - Kennedys statement that hes just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isnt going to help our prestige either. Lets look at the other side of the coin. Lets look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union. Lets look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy. Its growth rate is not what counts; its whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us. Were well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and dont run her down in order to build her up. We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this\"\"\",\"\"\" And good evening to you, Vice President Nixon. And now to meet the panel of correspondents. Frank McGee, NBC News; Charles Van Fremd, CBS News; Douglass Cater, Reporter magazine; Roscoe Drummond, New York Herald Tribune. Now, as youve probably noted, the four reporters include a newspaper man and a magazine reporter; these two selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates. The broadcasting representatives were chosen by their companies. The rules for this evening have been agreed upon by the representatives of both candidates and the radio and television networks and I should like to read them. There will be no opening statements by the candidates nor any closing summation. The entire hour will be devoted to answering questions from the reporters. Each candidate to be questioned in turn with opportunity for comment by the other. Each answer will be limited to two and one-half minutes, each comment to one and a half minutes. The reporters are free to ask any question they choose on any subject. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked. Time alone will dete- determine who will be asked the final question. Now the first question is from Mr. McGee and is for Senator Kennedy. Mr. Vice President, do you wish to comment? The next question is by Mr. Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon. Senator Kennedy, do you wish to comment? Mr. Cater has the next question for Senator Kennedy. Mr. Vice President, your comment? The next question is by Mr. Drummond for Vice President Nixon. Mr. Von Fremd has a question for Senator Kennedy. Any comment, Mr. Vice President? Mr. Caters question is for Vice President Nixon. Mr. Drummonds question is for Senator Kennedy. Mr. McGee has a question for Vice President Nixon. The next question is by Mr. Cater for Senator Kennedy. Next, Mr. Drummonds question for Vice President Nixon. Mr. McGee has the next question for Senator Kennedy. Gentlemen, if I may remind you, time is growing short, so please keep your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity. Mr. Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon. Mr. Drummonds question now for Senator Kennedy. Thank you gentlemen. As we mentioned at the opening of this program, the candidates agreed that the clock alone would determine who had the last word. The two candidates wish to thank the networks for the opportunity to appear for this discussion. I would repeat the ground rules likewise agreed upon by representatives of the two candidates and the radio and television networks. The entire hour was devoted to answering questions from the reporters. Each candidate was questioned in turn and each had the opportunity to comment on the answer of his opponent. The reporters were free to ask any question on any subject. Neither candidate was given any advance information on any question that would be asked. Those were the conditions agreed upon for this third meeting of the candidates tonight. Now I might add that also agreed upon was the fact that when the hour got down to the last few minutes, if there was not sufficient time left for another question and suitable time for answers and comment, the questioning would end at that point. That is the situation at this moment. And after reviewing the rules for this evening I might use the remaining moments of the hour to tell you something about the other arrangements for this debate with the participants a continent apart. I would emphasize first that each candidate was in a studio alone except for three photographers and three reporters of the press and the television technicians. Those studios identical in every detail of lighting, background, physical equipment, even to the paint used in decorating. We newsmen in a third studio have also experienced a somewhat similar isolation. Now, I would remind you the fourth in the series of these historic joint appearances, scheduled for Friday, October twenty-first. At that time the candidates will again share the same platform to discuss foreign policy. This is Bill Shadel. Goodnight.\"\"\"\n",
      "October 7 1960,MR. KENNEDY,MR. NIXON,\"\"\" In the first place Ive never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present. In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free. Where Ive been critical of the Administrations policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years. Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections. What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958. Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results. Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom. I hope some day it will rise; but I dont think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when weve almost ignored the needs of Latin America; weve beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution. Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets. In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions. Mr. Lodge, on Meet the Press a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident. The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security. But they were not in accordance with international law. And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is. The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958. We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration. The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident. The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956. That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore RooseveltMR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President. Well, Mr. Nixon hasnt discussed the two basic questions Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense. Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses. I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces. The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars more than the President was willing to use up till a week ago. Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations. We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States. Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations. Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it. We have not maintained our position and our prestige. A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970. Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been. The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts. Yes. We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S. meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba. And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people. Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that its far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos. We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists. I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency. This permits them to maintain their self-respect. It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth. And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be. I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund. And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that. We tried to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five years, on a long-term loan basis, which this Administration opposed. And unless were ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost. And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us. I think the United States can afford to do these things. I think that we could not afford not to do these things. This goes to our survival. And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if its developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, well have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas. I believe its essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example. I believe we can do it. If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.MR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President. Well Mr. Nixon has stated the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill. Im very familiar with it. It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five. I was the floor manager. We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times. We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives. Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia. Our bill was far more effective. The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas. Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens. I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security. Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until were able to get the people back to work. Five cents a day - thats what the food package averages per person. Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960. If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed. One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education. The other would be to make a judgment on whats the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy. Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that Ive read. The question is what were going to do in the future. Ive been critical of this Administration and Ive been critical of the President. In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech. I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined. Now what is the issue is what were going to do in the future. Now thats an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself. He feels that were moving ahead uh - in a - were not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that were moving ahead. I disagree. And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what were doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixons view. Thats the great issue. President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years. And thats the debate. Thats the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think its a important judgment. I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century. Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think thats going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties. If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America. In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa. We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than weve given to all of Africa the year before. Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything. Weve been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years. Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration. Hes had experience in it. And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that were facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I dont believe that were going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom. I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.MR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President. I have no disagreement with the Vice Presidents position on that. It - my view is the same as his. Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add. That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think its important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength. If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, its extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions. Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin. Its going to be a test of our nerve and will. Its going to be a test of our strength. And because were going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter were going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty. On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon. I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas. Well I dont think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable. In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy. If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States. I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that were going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens. Im talking about a national mood. Im talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe. We dont know what the futures going to bring. But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected. Now, many of the programs that Im talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States. Thats how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period. If were moving ahead, if were providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this countrys on the move, then were stronger, then we set a better example to the world. So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home. So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States. Were using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today. Were not able to consume what were able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains. And all I say is, I dont know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; Im confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States. And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life. I think its going to be difficult; but Im confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.MR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President. Well, Mr. Nixon uh- Ill just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet. Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet. And he defined that as someone who uses beans in place of meat. Now Ive seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed. You cant tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate. You cant tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed. I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food. And theyre not getting in many cases adequate shelter. And we ought to try to meet the problem. Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost. Theyre wholly inaccurate. I said last week I believed in a balanced budget. Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States. So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession. Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa. I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa. These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa. We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if its attacked. We say we will defend it if its part of a general attack on Formosa. But its extremely difficult to make that judgment. Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible. Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East. General Ridgway has said the same thing. I believe that when you get into a w- if youre going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line. One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked. I believe that we should defend Formosa. We should come to its defense. To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake. Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun. It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa. It leaves a hundred miles between the sea. But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think its unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa. I think that uh - we should protect our commitments. I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin. I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security weve guaranteed. But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa. And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, its been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself.MR. McGEE: Mr. Vice President. Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man. Abraham Lincoln was a great president of all the people; but he was selected by his party at a key time in history because his party stood for something. The Democratic party in this century has stood for something. It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the peoples welfare. It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman. The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon. They do stand for something. They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad. Thats the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record. And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.\"\"\",\"\"\" Well first of all, I dont agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953. As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States. Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba. He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there. I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, were glad to have a comparison with the previous administration. There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953. Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba. We think thats pretty good progress. Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country. Now Im very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind. As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position. And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well. For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty. Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear. There isnt any question but that we will defend our rights there. There isnt any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if its attacked. There also isnt any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom. No, Cuba is not lost, and I dont think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit. I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts. First of all, hes wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets. He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasnt the reason that he broke up the conference. Second, hes wrong in the analogies that he makes. The United States is a strong country. Whenever we do anything thats wrong, we can express regrets. But when the president of the United States is doing something thats right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev. Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred. This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part. We all remember Pearl Harbor. We lost three thousand American lives. We cannot afford an intelligence gap. And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information. I dont intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while were negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort. And I dont intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if Im doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States. My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform. I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment. And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts. Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed. Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools. That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active. And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership. And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes. Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody. I have talked to Negro mothers. Ive heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then cant go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola. This is wrong, and we have to do something about it. So, under the circumstances, what do we do? Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the PresidentMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area. But lets look at the performance. When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time. Let me s- look also at what I did. I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it. Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts. And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we havent had an adequate staff. Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which theres a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it. All that I can say is this Mr. Morgan, no matter how well were doing in the cold war, were not doing as well as we should. And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following. Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think its time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out. First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low. Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again. I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchevs uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhowers eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high. Now that, of course, is just one factor, but its a significant one. When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo. We were on one side; they were on the other side. What happened? There were seventy votes for our position and none for theirs. Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years. Thats a test of prestige. Every time the United States has been an one side and theyve been on the other side, our position has been sustained. Now looking to what we ought to do in the future. In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it. Its being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America. What do we need? What tools do we need to fight us? Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area. Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America. Id like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which hed been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs. They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years. They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense. Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well. So let me summarize by saying thisMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance. This is important. But its also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation. We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies. We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas. Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a billMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy. Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility. In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions. Im glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience. Let me make my position cl ear. I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration. Im proud of the record of this Administration. I dont stand on it because it isnt something to stand on but something to build on. Now looking at Senator Kennedys credentials No, of course I havent talked to Prime Minister Macmillan. It would not be appropriate for me to do so. The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period. As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear. I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace. I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success. We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris. There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up. He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasnt going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference. Now, if were going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress. Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped. So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this positionMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy. Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties. Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less. In my opinion theyre going to be de- be greater. I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes. I hope not. I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we dont have to. But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar. Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that. I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedys proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both. The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors. But it isnt going to be working that way. You cant add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it. After all, it isnt paid for by my money, it isnt paid for by his, but by the peoples money. I did. And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary. What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea. Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy. Hes said that its been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat. And Id like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated? In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China. In this Administration weve stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; weve stopped them in Indochina; weve stopped them in Lebanon; weve stopped them in other parts of the world. I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedys comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks were wrong. But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case. I dont think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low. I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because its wrong. I dont think it was helpful when he suggested - and Im glad hes corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States. Now this just wasnt true. Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration. But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world. Were the best fed; were the best clothed, with a better distribution of this worlds goods to all of our people than any people in history. Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize Americas strengths. It isnt necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up. Now so that we get it absolutely clearMR. McGEE: Senator Kennedy. I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point. I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well. Generals testified to that. And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States. I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldnt get into a war. But it didnt mean that. We had to go in when they came in. Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant. It isnt the few people who live on them - they are not too important. Its the principle involved. These two islands are in the area of freedom. The Nationalists have these two islands. We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists. If we do that we start a chain reaction; because the Communists arent after Quemoy and Matsu, theyre a- theyre after Formosa. In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea. I am against it. I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected.\"\"\",\"\"\" Senator Kennedy, would you care to comment?

Gentlemen, we have approximately four minutes remaining. May I ask you to make your questions and answers as brief as possible consistent with clarity. And Mr. Levy has a question for Vice President Nixon. Thank you gentlemen. Neither the questions from the reporters nor the answers you heard from Senator John Kennedy or Vice President Richard Nixon were rehearsed. By agreement neither candidate made an opening statement or a closing summation. They further agreed that the clock alone would decide who would speak last and each has asked me to express his thanks to the networks and their affiliated stations. Another program similar to this one will be presented Thursday, October thirteenth, and the final program will be presented Friday, October twenty-first. We hope this series of radio and television programs will help you toward a fuller understanding of the issues facing our country today and that on election day, November eighth, you will vote for the candidate of your choice. This is Frank McGee. Good night from Washington.\"\"\"\n",
      "September 26 1960,MR. KENNEDY,MR. NIXON,\"\"\" Mr. Smith, Mr. Nixon. In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain. We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival. Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself. The Chinese Communists have always had a large population. But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country. The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom. If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if were moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. If we fail, then freedom fails. Therefore, I think the question before the American people is Well, the Vice President and I came to the Congress together 1946; we both served in the Labor Committee. Ive been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable. Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead? I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which Ive discussed tonight. Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party. He was nominated by it. And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources. I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party. I hope he would grant me the same. The question before us is Well, I would say in the latter that the - and thats what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration. You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so its rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years. I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth. In regard to uh - price stability uh - Im not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices. In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had. I think its true of Latin America also. We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I dont think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor. Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos. The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. There are hundreds of thousands of them. They really dont - theyre not able to control their market very well. They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time. They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place. I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture. And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse. The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States. The automobile industry is the number one market for steel. So if the farmers economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country. So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one. Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance. The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth. Weve had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years. I think that this farm policy has failed. In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance. And that can only be done through governmental action. I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we wont have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent. I think Mr. Bensons program has failed. And I must say, after reading the Vice Presidents speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I dont believe that its very much different from Mr. Bensons. I dont think it provides effective governmental controls. I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Bensons theory. I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.MR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment? Well, Ill just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals. Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president. Theres no certain road to the presidency. There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president. I have been in the Congress for fourteen years. I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities. I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The question really is I didnt indicate. I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I dont believe that youre going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three. I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which were going to have to meet. And therefore Ive never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two. No. No. Not reducing the interest - - reducing the interest rate. In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960. What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that Ive talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound. Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security. The Vice President and I disagree on this. The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state. The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax. Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers salaries. I think thats a good investment. I think were going to have to do it. And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated. There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none. On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley. I believe in the balanced budget. And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession. Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues. Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly. When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February. The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state. The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries. On that question the Vice President and I disagreed. I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal. I dont want the federal government paying teachers salaries directly. But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee. And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass. Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget. That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars. That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record. My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead. Well as you take the bills - If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage. It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes. And I might say that two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted against a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage and a majority of the Democrats sustained it - nearly two-thirds of them voted for the dollar twenty-five. We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - its extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it. All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate. Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate. It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives. It was killed in the Rules Committee. And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House. Four Democrats voted for it. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against sending that bill to be considered by the members of the House of Representatives. Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight thats been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security. We wanted to tie it to Social Security. We offered an amendment to do so. Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it. And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it. In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs. But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.MR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment? Well, now lets look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme. One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business. I dont think thats extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal. Secondly was the federal aid to education bill. It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need. The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal. It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it. I dont say the Democrats are united in their support of the program. But I do say a majority are. And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it. The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds. It does not put a deficit on the Treasury. The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didnt agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security. So these are three programs which are quite moderate. I think it shows the difference between the two parties. One party is ready to move in these programs. The other party gives them lip service. Well, I think theyre serious. I think its a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to. We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within. We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert. I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat. The major threat is external and will continue.MR. SMITH: Mr. Nixon, comment? Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools. Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country. And I think we have a powerful country. I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if were going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources. The Soviet Union is making great gains. It isnt enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago. I want to compare what were doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength. I think thats the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government. The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours. I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight. I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship. I dont want to see the day when its sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction. Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged. Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill. The Kerr bill provided assistance to all those who were not on Social Security. I think its a very clear contrast. In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it. Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it. In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion. Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is\"\"\",\"\"\" Mr. Smith, Senator Kennedy. The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position. There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking. Were ahead in this competition, as Senator Kennedy, I think, has implied. But when youre in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead. And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead. Where, then, do we disagree? I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still. We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world. Now last year, of course, was 1958. That happened to be a recession year. But when we look at the growth of G.N.P. this year, a year of recovery, we find that its six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today. More about that later. Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner I have no comment. It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes. I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned. First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted. For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field. After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same. Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress. Within the Administration, as a chairman of the Presidents Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective. I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective. I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States. Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark. Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected. The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress. Now, I can only say this. Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council. I have been in the cabinet. I have met with the legislative leaders. I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters. The President has asked for my advice. I have given it. Sometimes my advice has been taken. Sometimes it has not. I do not say that I have made the decisions. And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions. All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it. As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isnt for me to say. Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedys is there for the people to consider. As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year. His experience has been different from mine. Mine has been in the executive branch. His has been in the legislative branch. I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.MR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy. Yes. I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedys speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt. I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes. As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes. As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security. That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security. He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development. Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesnt mean that you - the government doesnt have to put out the money this year. And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things Im awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasnt able to complete the argument. Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers salaries - at least thats the way I read his remarks. Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers salaries? Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then? Why do I take it now? We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reasonMR. SMITH: Senator Kennedys comment? Well obviously my views are a little different. First of all, I dont see how its possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led. I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans. It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats not getting a something through that particular committee. I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark. When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress. Because lets consider it. If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didnt they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue? The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them. It was because they were too extreme. And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress. I agree with Senator Kennedys appraisal generally in this respect. The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past. It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come. We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and its waged right here in the United States. Thats why we have to continue to be alert. It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy. We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow. And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon. And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his. The question again is not one of goals - were for those goals - its one of means. Not at all. As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make. Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing. Now that isnt the test of whether America moves. The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves. We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars. Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity. Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do. Now, the reason the Eisenhower Administration has moved, the reason that weve had the funds, for example, locally to build the schools, and the hospitals, and the highways, to make the progress that we have, is because this Administration has encouraged individual enterprise; and it has resulted in the greatest expansion of the private sector of the economy that has ever been witnessed in an eight-year period. And that is growth. That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.MR. SMITH: Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Senator Kennedy. First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth. The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have. But the reason for that is obvious. They start from a much lower base. Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product. Thats the same percentage that it was twenty years ago. And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago. Is this any reason for complacency? Not at all Because these are determined men. They are fanatical men. And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy. I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score. Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy. I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth. I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated. There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon. The one in the field of health is worth mentioning. Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it. It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance. But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it. His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not. And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all. Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his. The other point that I would make is this\"\"\",\"\"\" And now the opening statement by Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Thank you, Mr. Nixon. That completes the opening statements, and now the candidates will answer questions or comment upon one anothers answers to questions, put by correspondents of the networks. The correspondents Mr. Nixon, would you like to comment on that statement? The next question The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Warren. The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Vanocur. The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Novins. Mr. Nixon, your comment? The next question to Vice President Nixon from Mr. Warren. The next question to Senator Kennedy from Mr. Vanocur. The next question to Vice President Nixon fa- from Mr. Fleming. Mr. Warrens question for Senator Kennedy. Mr. Vanocurs question for Vice President Nixon. Can I have the summation time please? Weve completed our questions and our comments, and in just a moment, well have the summation time. Senator Kennedy, your conclusion. Thank you very much, gentlemen. This hour has gone by all too quickly. Thank you very much for permitting us to present the next president of the United States on this unique program. Ive been asked by the candidates to thank the American networks and the affiliated stations for providing time and facilities for this joint appearance. Other debates in this series will be announced later and will be on different subjects. This is Howard K. Smith. Good night from Chicago.\"\"\"\n"
