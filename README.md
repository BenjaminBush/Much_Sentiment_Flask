# Much_Sentiment

Project for UIowa Big Data Hackathon October 2016

Goal:
How do the debates impact a candidate's chances for presidency?
Sentiment analysis of word vector frequency from debate transcript used to analyze the following:

Analysis:
    - weighted_avg(word frequency * general usage) = accessibility of speech
    - blob of speech text --> grade level understanding (debate winner vs president winner)
    - market's response to debate vs debate winner (economic forces --> which one was a more successful measure of their  success to become president)
    - word frequency compared to pre and post debate scores joined on debate and presidential winner to indicate what issues are significant to public vs candidate
